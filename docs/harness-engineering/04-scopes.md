# Scopes

A scope is the dial that decides *which* of the framework's 33 stages run for a given kind of work, and which sit out. A bugfix doesn't need market research or environment provisioning, but it still runs the deployment pipeline and execution stages; a regulated enterprise feature needs the full lifecycle. Rather than asking the user to hand-pick stages every time, AI-DLC ships eleven named scopes — each one a curated EXECUTE/SKIP verdict over the full stage set, paired with workflow defaults such as depth, test strategy, and an optional review ceiling. Pick the scope and the rest cascades.

For a harness engineer, a scope is pure data, authored the same way every other primitive is — as a file. It is two halves: one `core/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file (its identity, routing metadata, and workflow defaults) plus a per-stage membership tag (each stage's frontmatter `scopes:` list naming the scopes it runs under). Adding or tuning a scope requires no TypeScript. This chapter walks the workflow: what a scope is made of, how to add a team scope, how to tune an existing one, and what the tooling checks for you versus what it leaves to you.

For the full eleven-scope catalog with use cases and the routing table users read, see [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy](../guide/05-scopes-and-depth.md) in the User Guide. This chapter is the authoring side of that same data.

## What a scope is made of

A scope is authored in two places, and the split is the whole idea: the scope's *identity* lives in its own file, and its *membership* (which stages run under it) lives transposed onto the stages.

**1. The scope file — `core/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md`.** One file per scope, mirroring `core/sensors/`. The `feature` scope's frontmatter looks like this:

```yaml
---
name: feature
depth: Standard
keywords: []
description: Full lifecycle for new features, practical depth
skeleton: on
---

# feature scope

Prose intent: why these stages, why skip those.
```

The scope frontmatter fields are:

| Field | Required | What it does |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| `name` | Yes | The scope name. Core files use `aidlc-<name>.md`; plugin scope files use a stem equal to `name`. |
| `depth` | Yes | The default detail level — `Minimal`, `Standard`, or `Comprehensive`. |
| `testStrategy` | No | Overrides test volume independent of depth. Defaults to matching `depth`. |
| `review_cap` | No | Maximum review class under this scope: `adversarial`, `advisory`, or `none`. Absence means no scope-level lowering. A cap can lower but never raise a stage's `review_class`; autonomous swarm reviews retain the stage's declared class. |
| `keywords` | No | Natural-language triggers for `/aidlc <freeform text>` auto-detection. Flat string lists may use block (`- item`) or flow (`[item, item]`) form; an empty list opts out. |
| `description` | No | The one-liner rendered in `/aidlc --help`. (The compiled scope-table in SKILL.md shows only Scope / Depth / TestStrategy / EXECUTE / Total, leaving the description out.) |
| `skeleton` | No | `on` opts the scope into the walking-skeleton ceremony when practices are scope-dependent; `off` or absence opts out. |
| `runner` | No | `true` includes the scope in the default generated scope-runner set. |
| `freeform_default` | No | `true` nominates this scope as the selection-aware fallback when the preferred core default (`classic`) is not enabled. |
| `change_control` | No | The scope's Change Control default, `strict` or `relaxed`: what happens when an input changes after a human approved or confirmed something (strict reopens the approval; relaxed records the change once, tells the human in one line, and continues). Absence means strict. The shipped defaults are strict on `enterprise`, `security-patch`, and `infra`, relaxed on the rest. A memory layer's `## Change Control` section (`Mode: strict`) wins over every scope default and every per-intent flip; see [Change Control](../guide/13-customization.md#change-control). |

The loader rejects duplicate scope `name` values across files and names both
files in the error.

### Freeform default

`freeform_default: true` lets an install nominate the scope used when the
internal `classic` default is unavailable after plugin
selection. The nomination is checked before the sole-enabled-plugin fallback,
so a plugin with several scopes can choose its lean default instead of accepting
the alphabetically first scope.

At most one **enabled** scope may declare `freeform_default: true`. Graph
compilation fails and names every claimant when the selected core/plugin set
contains more than one. Claims on disabled plugins do not conflict until those
plugins are enabled together. The field does not repair explicit typos:
an unknown `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` value still fails validation.

### Walking-skeleton default

The optional `skeleton:` field controls the scope-dependent walking-skeleton
stance. `skeleton: on` means that when the team's `## Walking Skeleton`
practices resolve to `scope-dependent`, Construction opens with the
walking-skeleton ceremony for this scope. `skeleton: off` means the first Bolt
runs as a regular Bolt. Absence defaults to off, so composed/runtime-approved
scopes and plugin scopes do not conjure a skeleton Bolt unless they opt in
explicitly.

### Change Control default

The optional `change_control:` field is the value a new intent on this scope
starts with, written to its state file at creation as
`- **Change Control**: <value> (from scope <name>)`. The human can flip it for
that one intent with `/aidlc --change-control <value>` or a plain-chat request;
an older intent without this line remains strict until explicitly set, while
the next new intent starts from the scope default again. To hold a value for
everyone on the repo, do not edit eleven scope files: declare it once in memory
(`## Change Control` with `Mode: strict` in `aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/org.md`,
`team.md`, or `project.md`). A memory `strict` wins over every scope default and
refuses chat or flag flips by naming the file; a memory `relaxed` or an absent
section has no effect. The validation error for anything other than the two
values names the file and the allowed values; the per-intent command repairs an
invalid state line.

**2. The membership tag — each stage's `scopes:` frontmatter.** A stage names the scopes it runs under in its own frontmatter, in `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md`:

```yaml
scopes:
  - enterprise
  - feature
  - mvp
```

A stage that names a scope is `EXECUTE` under it; absence is `SKIP`. Packaging *transposes* every stage's `scopes:` list into the compiled EXECUTE/SKIP grid at `<harness-dir>/tools/data/scope-grid.json`. The grid is an ignored generated projection that the runtime reads; you never hand-edit or commit it. The 3 initialization stages name every scope (they always run).

The one judgment call worth understanding is the relationship between `depth` and `testStrategy`. Depth controls how much detail each stage's artifacts carry; test strategy controls how many tests get generated. They're independent on purpose. Most shipped scopes leave `testStrategy` off so it inherits from `depth` — `classic` is Standard/Standard and `express` is Minimal/Minimal. `workshop` demonstrates the explicit split with Standard depth and Minimal testing. If your scope wants a split, declare both. For what each level means, see [The 3 Depth Levels](../guide/05-scopes-and-depth.md#the-3-depth-levels) and [The 3 Test Strategy Levels](../guide/05-scopes-and-depth.md#the-3-test-strategy-levels) in the User Guide.

The exhaustive field-by-field contract — including how `keywords` are word-boundary matched and how the alphabetical-scope tie-break resolves an ambiguous freeform invocation — lives in [Contributing § Adding a Scope](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope) in the Developer Reference. This chapter summarizes the decisions; that section is the normative spec.

## How scopes relate to stages

A scope and a stage point at each other from opposite ends, and it helps to hold both directions in view.

A **stage** declares its own identity — its phase, its lead agent, the artifacts it consumes and produces, and now the scopes it runs under (its `scopes:` list). A **scope** declares its identity, routing metadata, and workflow defaults in its own `.md` file, with no per-stage membership inside it; membership lives on the stages. The binding between them is the scope name. When you add a new stage (see [Adding a Stage](02-adding-a-stage.md)), you put the scope membership *on that stage* — its `scopes:` list names every scope that should run it. A stage that names no scope is `SKIP` everywhere. The transpose at compile turns those per-stage lists into the grid, so membership is authored once, on the stage, rather than re-declared in eleven separate scope blocks.

That separation is the same data-versus-code line the rest of this guide rests on (see [Harness Engineer Guide](00-overview.md)). The scope file is data about *identity*; the stage's `scopes:` list is data about *membership*; the compiled grid is the transpose of the two.

## Adding a team scope

Suppose your team wants a `hotfix` scope — leaner than `bugfix`, for the urgent production patch where you want a regression test and a deploy, nothing else. The change is a new scope file, a `scopes:` tag on each stage that should run, and regenerated local projections. Mirror the discipline below; the verification steps and the full command lines are in [Contributing § Adding a Scope](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope).

### Steps

1. **Drop `core/scopes/aidlc-hotfix.md`.** Copy `aidlc-bugfix.md` (the closest existing scope) and edit the frontmatter: set `name: hotfix`, pick `depth`, add `keywords` if you want freeform auto-detection (`[hotfix, urgent]`), a `description` for the help text, `skeleton: on|off` for the scope-dependent Construction ceremony default, `freeform_default: true` only if this is the selected install's unique fallback nomination, `testStrategy` only if it should diverge from `depth`, and `review_cap` only if the scope should lower stage reviews. Write a short prose body explaining the intent.

2. **Tag the stages that should run under `hotfix`.** In each stage you want `EXECUTE` (under `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/`), add `hotfix` to its frontmatter `scopes:` list. A stage you don't tag is `SKIP` for the scope. The 3 initialization stages must include it (they always run).

3. **Regenerate.** Run `bun scripts/package.ts` to rebuild the ignored harness projections, including `scope-grid.json` and the compiled scope table. Run `bun scripts/package.ts --check` to confirm two independent source-only builds are byte-identical.

4. **Verify the scope resolves and is accepted.** Run `/aidlc --doctor`. Then confirm an init under the new scope produces a state file with the right `Scope:` line, and that it's accepted as an env default and as a mid-workflow `--scope` change.

5. **Verify keyword inference** (only if you populated `keywords`). Confirm a freeform phrase containing one of your triggers detects the new scope rather than falling through to `feature`.

6. **Update the scope-aware docs and add a routing test.** Several docs enumerate scopes by hand — the User Guide's scope reference and routing table, the customization chapter's valid-values list, and the orchestrator reference's scope-to-stage mapping. Update them in the same change. If your scope skips stages in a pattern no existing scope uses, add a workflow test modeled on the existing per-scope tests.

7. **(Optional) Generate a typeable runner.** A scope is fully usable via `/aidlc --scope <name>` the moment its file lands — no runner needed. If you want a one-word command (`/aidlc-hotfix`), add `runner: true` to the scope frontmatter and run `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts scopes`; `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts scopes --all` emits `skills/aidlc-<scope>/SKILL.md` for every scope file regardless of that flag. Each runner is a thin shell that drives `aidlc-orchestrate next --scope <name>` to `done` with the scope baked in, plus a "Starting unrelated new work?" section carrying the same recognize, offer (`AskUserQuestion`, never auto-create), and `next --new-intent --scope <name>` guidance the `/aidlc` orchestrator has. The runner packages an already-runnable scope, and the scope file is its definition. It carries no `hooks:` block: the deterministic spine (audit, sensors, rebuild-stage-graph, state validation) is registered project-wide in `settings.json`, so every runner inherits it for free. Re-run the generator (or `scopes --check`) whenever you add or rename a scope file.

### What validates automatically

This implementation derives the valid-scope list from `.claude/scopes/*.md` presence at runtime through `validScopes()`, so a lot falls into place the moment the file lands:

- The scope is valid everywhere at once — `init`, `--scope` change, env-default resolution, and `doctor` all consult the same helper, so none of them needs a code edit.
- Error messages list your scope in alphabetical order with no change.
- If you gave it `keywords`, freeform `/aidlc <text>` auto-detects it as soon as the frontmatter list is populated — no SKILL.md prose edit, just the table regeneration.
- Packaging always derives the grid from the current stage YAML, so stale local generated bytes are not release inputs.

### What does NOT validate automatically

- **A `scopes:` tag with a typo'd scope name still parses.** A stage frontmatter that names `hotfx` instead of `hotfix` compiles cleanly — it just produces a grid column nobody asks for. The catch is that `validScopes()` derives from the `.md` files, so a scope with no file is rejected at invocation; but a mistyped tag on a stage silently drops that stage from the real scope. `/aidlc --doctor` and a per-scope test are the guardrails.
- **A stale local projection can mislead manual inspection.** If you edit a stage's `scopes:` and keep using an old ignored `dist/` tree, that local runtime still contains the old grid. Regenerate before local runtime checks; CI and release assembly always rebuild from source.
- **Per-scope phase-sequence coverage.** The shipped phase-sequence test iterates a hardcoded list of the known scope names; a new scope isn't exercised by it until you extend that list. Add your scope to it in the same change.
- **The hand-maintained docs.** Nothing greps the docs for you. The scope reference, the routing table, and the customization valid-values list are prose; keep them in step with the scope files yourself.

## Tuning an existing scope

Tuning is a smaller edit, but it lands on the stage, not the scope. Two changes come up often:

- **Flip a stage in or out.** Add or remove the scope name from a stage's `scopes:` list. This is how you'd, say, add `mvp` to `observability-setup`'s `scopes:` because your team always wires monitoring even for a first cut. One tag, then regenerate with `bun scripts/package.ts` and run `--doctor`.
- **Change a default depth, test strategy, or review ceiling.** Adjust `depth`, add/remove `testStrategy`, or add/remove `review_cap` in the scope's `core/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` frontmatter. The first two recalibrate artifact and test volume; `review_cap` lowers stage review classes to `adversarial`, `advisory`, or `none` without ever raising them. Because each scope carries its own defaults, the change applies to every workflow that selects the scope. Per-run `--depth`, `--test-strategy`, and `--review` can lower the corresponding behavior further.

Either way, the regenerate-and-doctor pair from step 3 above applies. The edit is small; the verification is the same.

A note on layering: tuning the shipped scopes edits framework-shipped files directly — a stage's `scopes:` tag or a shipped `core/scopes/aidlc-*.md`. That's legitimate for a fork that wants different defaults, but be aware you're changing files that carry the `aidlc-` lineage and a framework upgrade may want to reconcile them. Adding a net-new scope file alongside the shipped eleven is the cleaner path when you want a team-specific behavior without touching the defaults everyone else relies on.
