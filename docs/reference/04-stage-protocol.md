# Stage Protocol Reference

Human-readable restructuring of the machine-oriented protocol family authored
under `core/aidlc-common/protocols/`. Preserves all rules, conditions,
and behaviors while reorganizing for developer consumption. Section references
map to the static protocol or the named conditional module.

> For stage file *format* (YAML frontmatter, body conventions), see
> [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md). This chapter covers runtime
> execution behaviour.

> **Path convention.** Intent-scoped artifacts, state, and the audit trail live
> under the active intent's **record dir** —
> `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`, written `<record>/` below.
> Reverse Engineering outputs instead live in the space-level, per-repository
> store `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`. The audit trail is a

> glob and merge by timestamp), not a single file.

## Protocol File Structure

The stage protocol is split across seven files, loaded conditionally by the
conductor based on workflow context:

| File | Contents | When Loaded |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `stage-protocol.md` | Core protocol: approval gates, completion messages, question flow, state tracking, agent persona loading, depth guidance, terminology, content validation, and the §13 Learnings Ritual | Every stage (mandatory) |
| `stage-protocol-recovery.md` | Error Recovery + Change Handling | On session resume, or when a change event is detected mid-stage |
| `stage-protocol-governance.md` | Phase Boundary Verification (§13) | At phase boundaries (1.7->2.1, 2.9->3.1, 3.7->4.1) |
| `stage-protocol-reviewer.md` | Reviewer dispatch, receipts, read scope, terminal ordering, and NOT-READY loop | When the directive names an effective reviewer |
| `stage-protocol-ensemble.md` | Ensemble topology, subagent returns, contribution files, and objection triage | For subagent, pipeline, mob, or support-agent stages |
| `stage-protocol-construction.md` | Planned Bolt-major ceremony (labeled non-executable future-state), the shipped per-unit walk, Build-and-Test loop-back, receipts, and waves | On the first Construction directive of the session and every invoke-swarm |
| `stage-protocol-swarm.md` | Harness-specific autonomous fan-out, convergence, finalize, and reviewer boundary | Every invoke-swarm |

### Conditional Loading Logic (from SKILL.md Routing)

The conductor's Routing section defines the loading rules:

- **`stage-protocol.md`**: load every stage -- core gates, question format,
  state tracking, completion messages.
- **`stage-protocol-recovery.md`**: load on session resume or when a change
  event is detected mid-stage. This keeps error recovery and change handling
  out of context for normal forward-progress stages.
- **`stage-protocol-governance.md`**: load at phase boundaries
  (1.7->2.1, 2.9->3.1, 3.7->4.1) to run the Phase Boundary Verification
  traceability check. This limits governance overhead to the points where it
  is needed.
- **`stage-protocol-reviewer.md`**: load when `protocol_modules` includes
  `reviewer`, or when the directive carries a reviewer.
- **`stage-protocol-ensemble.md`**: load when `protocol_modules` includes
  `ensemble`; the fallback trigger is a dispatched topology or support agents.
- **`stage-protocol-construction.md`**: load on the first Construction
  directive of the session and every invoke-swarm.
- **`stage-protocol-swarm.md`**: load for invoke-swarm.

Before running the stage body, the conductor reads every module named by
`directive.protocol_modules` and skips modules already loaded in the session.

The split reduces fixed context during normal stage execution while ensuring
rare-path reviewer, ensemble, Construction, swarm, recovery, and governance
rules are loaded when relevant. Capturing in-stage corrections as durable Rules
is handled by the §13 Learnings Ritual in `stage-protocol.md` (loaded every
stage), not by a separate governance flow.

---

## Overview

The stage protocol is the mandatory behavioral contract governing how every
stage in the AI-DLC workflow executes. All 33 stages across five phases
(Initialization, Ideation, Inception, Construction, Operation) follow this protocol without
exception. The conductor (`SKILL.md`) hands stage execution to agent
personas; the protocol stays independent of phase and agent, defining
the structural rules that wrap around any stage's domain-specific work.

The protocol covers: approval gates, completion messages, question flow, state
tracking, agent persona loading, conditional reviewer/ensemble/Construction/
swarm behavior, error recovery, change handling, depth guidance, content
validation, the §13 Learnings Ritual, and phase boundary verification.

### Critical Compliance Checklist

Before and during every stage, verify these commonly missed steps:

State transitions and audit emissions are tool-owned rather than
hand-written audit blocks. The conductor reports forward progress through
`aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage <slug>`; the dispatcher delegates to the orchestration
engine, which delegates to the
state tool, which atomically updates state and emits the paired audit event
with a fresh timestamp.

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| 1 | At the approval gate, call `aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage <slug> --result awaiting-approval`. Gate-bound sensors run once per existing deliverable before the transaction. A blocking binding requires a verified pass. To override, log and present the separate `Fix findings` / `Override blocking sensors` decision, wait for the exact human-backed answer, then retry with `--override-blocking-sensors --user-input "Override blocking sensors"`; a bare flag and autonomous mode are refused. The engine then flips state from `[-]` to `[?]` AwaitingApproval and emits `STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL` atomically, so status shows the held gate while the prompt is open. (`STAGE_STARTED` / the `[-]` transition was emitted when the stage became active.) |
| 2 | For non-gate questions, log options BEFORE calling `AskUserQuestion` via `aidlc engine log decision` (not by hand-writing to the `audit/` shards), then log the exact response via `aidlc engine log answer`. |
| 3 | After an approval-gate response, call `aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage <slug> --result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"` for approval or `aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage <slug> --result rejected --user-input "Request Changes" --reason "<feedback>"` for request-changes. Never call the log tool's `decision` or `answer` verb for the gate. After revision work, report `--result revised` before re-presenting it. |
| 4 | Never summarize user input -- pass exact option labels to the owning log or report tool; for automated stages use `N/A -- [reason]` |
| 5 | One audit entry per interaction -- the log/state tools enforce single-event emission; never merge multiple events into one call |
| 6 | At stage end, call `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"` (gated stages) or `report --stage <slug> --result completed` (Initialization). The engine flips `[?]`/`[-]` to `[x]`, emits `GATE_APPROVED` when gated, and emits `STAGE_COMPLETED` atomically through the state tool |
| 7 | Mark previous stage task `completed` and current stage task `in_progress` with `activeForm` BEFORE work begins (the `sync-workflow-state` hook handles state syncing) |
| 8 | Use ONLY event types from `knowledge/aidlc-shared/audit-format.md` -- the state and log tools enforce this; never write directly to the `audit/` shards |
| 9 | Do NOT hand-write lifecycle events or invoke lifecycle verbs on `aidlc-state.ts`. Report outcomes through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`; the engine's internal state call emits the atomic audit rows |

---

## Approval Gates

Every stage except the 3 Initialization stages requires explicit user approval
before advancing. Approval uses `AskUserQuestion` with structured UI options.

The gate corresponds to the `[?]` AwaitingApproval checkbox state in `aidlc-state.md`; rejection transitions the stage to `[R]` Revising. See [State Machine](12-state-machine.md) for the full stage state diagram and the canonical `GATE_APPROVED` / `GATE_REJECTED` / `STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL` emitters.

*(Protocol Section 1)*

### Standard 2-Option Gate

The default gate presents exactly two choices -- **Approve** (mark complete,
advance) or **Request Changes** (user provides feedback, stage re-executes,
gate re-presents):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "[Stage Name] complete. How would you like to proceed?",
    header: "Approval",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Approve", description: "Continue to [next stage]" },
      { label: "Request Changes", description: "Provide revision feedback" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

`[next stage]` is rendered verbatim from the run-stage directive's `next_stage`
field (the display name of the next in-scope stage, computed by the engine at
emit time), or `Complete workflow` when `next_stage` is null. The conductor
never guesses the next stage.

If a reply matches none of the choices currently shown, the conductor quotes
the received reply briefly, says that it did not match an offered choice, and
re-presents every valid choice in the same turn. It does not report a lifecycle
transition, record a decision, or consume the gate turn for that reply.

**No Emergent Behavior Rule:** Construction and Operation stages (phases 3-4)
must always use this 2-option format. They must never introduce additional
navigation options. Two sanctioned carve-outs exist: the revision escape
hatch (below) and the Build-and-Test failure loop-back in the construction
protocol module (`aidlc-common/protocols/stage-protocol-construction.md`,
"Build-and-Test failure loop-back" -- the bounded 3.6 to 3.5 repair loop with
its impact-estimated halt-and-ask question).

The loop-back has two deterministic re-entry routes. If Code Generation has
never used lifecycle receipts, preserved artifacts can settle every Unit and
the engine may emit the all-covered `gate: true` fast path. Once any lifecycle
row exists, receipt mode is sticky: the jump invalidates the old settlement
receipts and the engine re-emits per-Unit work so `unit start` / `unit complete`
are minted again. Both routes apply the planned fix and deterministic
Modify/Keep decisions before the gate and MUST produce a fresh
`REVIEW_COMPLETED` for every applicable Unit, because `STAGE_JUMPED` invalidates
all earlier reviews and the completion precondition refuses stale coverage.
Under unit-major the replay stays on this serial walk and never swarms.

The jump opens a new stage attempt, so Plan Approval IS re-run for the repaired
plan: blank `[Answer]:`, regenerate the fingerprint, and record a fresh
decision/human-turn/answer receipt before any fix generation. The Loop-Back Log
records the plan delta. The gated "Retry with fix" answer authorizes the jump, not
the plan content.

### Conditional 3rd Option

Ideation and Inception stages (phases 1-2) may conditionally include a third
option when a previously skipped stage could be added back:

```
{ label: "Add [Skipped Stage]", description: "Include [stage] which was skipped" }
```

This is the only circumstance for a 3rd option in phases 1-2. The label must
reference the specific skipped stage.

### Revision Escape Hatch

After 3 "Request Changes" cycles on the same stage, the 4th and subsequent
approval gates add a third option:

```
{ label: "Accept as-is", description: "Archive current version and move on" }
```

The question text changes to include the cycle count:
`"[Stage Name] -- this is revision cycle [N]. How would you like to proceed?"`

**When "Accept as-is" is selected:** log in the `audit/` shards ("User accepted stage
output as-is after [N] revision cycles"), mark complete, proceed. This
overrides the No Emergent Behavior Rule for Construction stages only when
the threshold is reached.

**Pre-activation notice:** After the 2nd cycle, include: "After one more
revision, an 'Accept as-is' option will become available."

## Completion Messages

Every stage ends with this 5-part structure, in order. All parts mandatory.

*(Protocol Section 2)*

### Part 0: Audit Logging

The gate's audit trail is report-owned:
1. Before presenting the gate, `report --result awaiting-approval` records the held gate (`STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL`)
2. After the response, `report --result approved|rejected --user-input "<exact choice>"` records the user's choice (`GATE_APPROVED`/`GATE_REJECTED`); no separate log entry is added for the gate prompt or choice

### Part 1: Announcement

```markdown
# [emoji] [Stage Name] Complete
```

Emoji defined by each stage file. Always a level-1 heading.

### Part 2: Summary

Structured bullet-point summary of what was produced:
- Factual and content-focused -- no workflow instructions ("please review")
- Include an inline summary table (5-10 lines) of key artifacts:
  ```
  | Artifact | Contents |
  |----------|----------|
  | requirements.md | 6 FR groups (18 sub-requirements), 4 NFRs |
  | requirements-analysis-questions.md | 5 questions, all answered |
  ```
- **First completion of a session** must include:
  `**Project depth**: [Minimal/Standard/Comprehensive] -- depth adapts artifact detail. You can request different depth at any approval gate.`

### Part 3: Review + Approval

```markdown
**Review:** `<record>/[path to artifacts]`
```

Followed by the `AskUserQuestion` approval gate (see Approval Gates section).

### Part 4: Progress Update

After user approves, display before proceeding:

```
Progress: [N]/[total] overall | [phase-N]/[phase-total] [Phase] stages complete. Next: [Next Stage Name]
```

Count only current-phase stages. Include completed and skipped in numerator.
Example: `Progress: 13/33 overall | 3/7 IDEATION stages complete. Next: Approval & Handoff`

---

## Question Flow

When a stage gathers user input through questions, the protocol defines a
tri-mode interaction flow with batching rules, mandatory answer analysis,
and ambiguity detection.

*(Protocol Section 3)*

### Tri-Mode System

**Step 1: Create the questions file** in the appropriate `<record>/`
directory using `[Answer]:` tag format with options A-E. Every ordinary
question must end with `X. Other (please specify)`. The dedicated Consolidated
Summary Confirmation is the sole exception: its **Looks correct / Request
changes** options are unlettered. All `[Answer]:` tags start blank.
Multi-select questions add "(select all that apply)" to the question text;
answer format: `[Answer]: A, B, E`.

**Step 2: Present mode choice:**

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "I've created [N] questions at `[file path]`. How would you like to answer them?",
    header: "Questions",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Guide me", description: "Walk through each question interactively here" },
      { label: "I'll edit the file", description: "I'll fill in the answers in the file directly" },
      { label: "Chat", description: "Discuss freely -- I'll extract decisions from our conversation" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

Log the mode choice to the `audit/` shards. Users can switch modes mid-stage.

#### Guide Me (Interactive Mode)

- Present via `AskUserQuestion` in batches (max 4 questions per call, max 4
  options per question)
- Questions with 5+ options: split across multiple calls (4 options each).
  User must see every option. File retains full option set.
- Built-in "Other" triggers discussion. Tell user before first batch:
  "Select 'Other' on any question to discuss it before answering."
- After each batch, IMMEDIATELY write answers to the questions file
- Log each batch with fresh ISO timestamp
- Present a consolidated answer summary, then print
  `aidlc-review-brief.ts summary --stage <slug> --questions-file <path>` before
  the structured **Looks correct** / **Request changes** confirmation. The
  deterministic brief names the stage, questions file, generated artifacts,
  why the decision is required now, and the exact effect of both choices. Do
  not ask for confirmation as bare prose. Before presenting it, append or reset a dedicated
  **Consolidated Summary Confirmation** entry in the stage questions file with
  both options and a blank `[Answer]:`. Record the prompt with
  `aidlc-log.ts decision --checkpoint summary-confirmation --questions-file
  <path>`, stop for the human, write the exact choice, then record it with the
  matching `aidlc-log.ts answer` command. The receipt binds the human turn to
  the exact questions-file digest. On **Request changes**, ask **"What should
  change?"** and stop again before editing any answer; after feedback and
  revision, reset the confirmation to blank before re-prompting. Any other
  reply is acknowledged as not matching an offered choice, both valid choices
  are re-presented in the same turn, and neither the tag nor receipt is written.

#### Edit File (Self-Guided Mode)

- Tell user: "Edit the file at `[file path]`. When done, send **done** or
  **ready** and I'll continue."
- WAIT for completion signal. Do not read file or proceed until signaled.
- Present the consolidated summary and use the same persisted, receipt-backed
  confirmation as Guide Me. Self-guided editing does not waive confirmation.

#### Chat (Freeform Mode)

- Open-ended conversation; extract decisions as they emerge
- End signal: "When ready to proceed, say **done** and I'll summarize."
- Write extracted answers to file with value, timestamp, and `**Mode:** chat`
- Present the decision summary, then persist and use the same **Looks correct / Request changes** structured confirmation before proceeding
- Best for: exploratory stages, brainstorming, questions needing discussion

**Step 4: Verify completeness.** Read file, confirm all `[Answer]:` tags
filled. If any blank, present unanswered via `AskUserQuestion`. Do not
proceed with partial answers. The file is the authoritative record.

### Batch Rules

| Constraint | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Questions per `AskUserQuestion` call | Max 4 |
| Options per question per call | Max 4 |
| Questions with 5+ options | Split across multiple calls |

### Answer Analysis

After collecting answers, analyze ALL responses (mandatory):
- **Vague answers**: "mix of", "not sure", "depends", "probably"
- **Contradictions** between answers
- **Missing details** needed for next step

If ANY ambiguity found, create follow-up questions and resolve before
proceeding. **When in doubt, ask.**

### Ambiguity Detection

**Invalid/missing answer handling:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Blank or underscore-only `[Answer]:` | List unanswered, ask user to complete |
| Answer not matching options (A-E, X) and not clear free-text | Ask user to clarify |
| Ambiguous ("maybe B", "either A or C") | Ask user to commit to single choice |

**Contradiction detection** -- cross-check full answer set for:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Scope mismatch | "Keep it simple" + enterprise-grade feature requests |
| Risk mismatch | "Security not a concern" + sensitive data handling |
| Technology conflicts | Offline-first + real-time collaboration |
| Timeline vs. scope | MVP timeline + full-feature scope |

When detected: present contradictory answers side by side, explain conflict,
ask targeted follow-up. Do NOT proceed until resolved.

**Overconfidence prevention:**
- Default to asking, not assuming. Never proceed with ambiguity.
- Red flags requiring follow-up: single-word answers to open-ended questions;
  "whatever you think" / "up to you"; contradictory signals; question-dodging;
  relaxing, lowering, or disabling a previously defined quality target (for
  example, a test coverage threshold) instead of meeting it
- When user defers to AI: "I want to make sure the design reflects YOUR
  priorities. Could you tell me [specific aspect]?"

### Plan and Question File Location

Files are co-located with stage artifacts, not centralized. Example:
`<record>/inception/user-stories/user-stories-questions.md`. All inputs,
questions, and outputs for a stage live in the same directory.

---

## State Tracking

State is maintained at multiple levels: stage checkboxes in the state file,
task status in the sidebar, ISO timestamps for audit entries, and structured
audit log entries.

*(Protocol Section 4)*

### Checkbox States

| Checkbox | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Not started |
| `[-]` | In progress (executing, not yet approved) |
| `[?]` | Awaiting human approval |
| `[R]` | Revising after rejection |
| `[x]` | Completed (approved by user) |
| `[S]` | Skipped by a justified current-stage report or navigation |

**Enforcement:** The engine marks these states; stage prose and conductors do
not. Report gate and terminal outcomes through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts`.

**`[S]` behavior:**
- Set by `report --stage <current> --result skipped --reason "<reason>"`, scope composition, or Stage/Phase Jump
- Excluded from statusline progress counts (not counted in total or done)
- Preserved while the engine routes onward; never paired with `STAGE_COMPLETED`
- On resume, treated as completed for task tracking (task created and immediately marked completed)
- A reported skip requires an explicit current stage and nonblank reason; single-stage runs reject it

### Task Status Transitions

Before beginning any stage, transition sidebar tasks:

1. Previous stage task `in_progress` -> mark `completed`
2. Current stage task -> mark `in_progress` with `activeForm: "Running [Stage Name]"`

Rules: task must be `in_progress` for spinner to display. Update BEFORE
reading stage file. Applies to all 33 stages. If task IDs lost (compaction),
use `TaskList` to find by subject. For skipped stages:
`TaskUpdate({ taskId: [ID], status: "completed", description: "[original] -- Skipped: [reason]" })`

### Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

Two-level tracking must stay in sync:
- **Plan-level**: individual work items (each user story, each component)
- **State-level**: stage completion in `aidlc-state.md`

If a step is done, its checkbox is checked. If checked, step must be done.
Update immediately after completing each step.

### Timestamps

Format: ISO 8601 UTC via `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`. Execute via Bash.
Never date-only. One Bash call per audit entry -- never reuse timestamps.

### Audit Log Formats

`<record>/audit/` (per-clone shards) rules: always append (never overwrite); "User Input"
field must be COMPLETE and UNMODIFIED; log prompts BEFORE showing; log
responses AFTER receiving; create with `# AI-DLC Audit Log` header if missing;
backup if corrupted; retry once if Edit fails (hooks may modify between
Read and Edit).

#### Standard Conversation Event

```markdown
## [Stage Name]
**Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]
**User Input**: "[Complete raw input -- never summarize]"
**AI Response**: "[Action taken]"
**Context**: [Stage, decision made]
---
```

#### Error Log

**Context**: [Stage name, file path, question numbers covered]
---
```

### Conversation Event Logging Checklist

`PostToolUse` hook auto-logs file writes. Conversation events must be logged
manually (most commonly missed step).

**At each approval gate:** (1) BEFORE `AskUserQuestion` -- report
`awaiting-approval`. (2) AFTER response -- report `approved` or `rejected` with
the exact user input. The report-owned lifecycle events are the gate's complete
audit record; do not call `aidlc-log.ts decision` or `aidlc-log.ts answer`.

**At each non-gate question interaction:** AFTER receiving answers -- append
the Q&A summary through `aidlc-log.ts answer`.

---

## Agent Persona Loading

Each stage specifies lead and optional support agents. Personas load through
a 6-step knowledge order building from broad context to stage-specific
artifacts.

*(Static protocol: `stage-protocol.md`, Section 5)*

### 6-Step Knowledge Loading Order

See [Knowledge System](10-knowledge-system.md) for the full loading order.

Steps 1-3 ship with the framework. Steps 4-5 are user-managed. Step 6 is
dynamic per workflow position.

### Inline Stages and Inline Mob Leads

1. Apply the ordered `load-steering` sequence before `run-stage`. It delivers
   every substantive active-space rule as content and re-runs on every stage.
2. Read every `inline_context_paths` entry: lead + supports for `inline`, and
   the lead only for `mob` because mob supports are dispatched. Persona and
   knowledge remain path-loaded. Show any `context_warnings` verbatim and
   continue with the readable roster. Agent names alone are not loaded context.
3. Apply every loaded perspective during execution. Do not omit support-agent
   perspectives on `inline` or the lead's on `mob`.

### Subagent Stages

1. Dispatch the named harness agent; its config loads the persona and
   knowledge (reviewer checklists are absorbed into the reviewer agents'
   bodies at build time).
2. Paste the accumulated `load-steering` rule bundle verbatim into the brief;
   pass relevant prior-artifact paths and task instructions rather than copied
   persona or knowledge prose.
3. Select the agent named by the stage metadata.

### Multi-Agent Stages (Ensemble Topologies)

*(Conditional module: `stage-protocol-ensemble.md`, Section 5)*

*How* the conductor brings support agents in follows `directive.mode` — the stage's
communication topology: on an `inline` stage the support agents are personas the
conductor loads into its own context (voices, not dispatches); on `subagent`
(hub-and-spoke), `pipeline` (chain), and `mob` (mesh as bounded rounds) each support
agent is a real, independently dispatched collaborator. Everyone writes their own
work: on subagent/mob each collaborator writes a contribution file (Contribution +
Positions, §11) that the lead integrates — the lead alone edits the `produces[]`
artifacts, and the contribution files are the engine-checked completion evidence;
on pipeline the chain links advance the artifacts directly and the final link leaves
them complete. Who sees what differs per topology — spokes are mutually blind, chain
links see all upstream work, mob objectors get one confirm-or-maintain round while
judgment-call objections surface to the human mid-stage — but on every topology the
conductor performs every delegation; agents never spawn subagents. See
`stage-protocol-ensemble.md` for the full contract.

Example: Feasibility uses `aidlc-architect-agent` (lead) + `aidlc-aws-platform-agent` +
`aidlc-compliance-agent`, all inline. The mob showcase is `user-stories`: the
`aidlc-product-agent` drafts personas and stories; design, developer, and quality
collaborators contribute against that draft while mutually blind; then the lead
integrates their work before the gate, with `aidlc-product-lead-agent` reviewing.
The hub-and-spoke showcase is `practices-discovery`: pipeline-deploy lead draft,
mutually blind quality, developer, and devsecops contributions, human interview,
then lead integration. Its gate offers **Approve** / **Request Changes**; after
Approve, `practices-promote` must commit both the affirmed timestamp and a
`PRACTICES_AFFIRMED` audit receipt from the current stage attempt before the
conductor reports the stage approved.

### The 11 Domain Agents

The full 14-agent roster comprises 11 domain agents, 2 review-only agents, and
the adaptive-workflows composer. The domain agents that lead and support stage
work are:

aidlc-product-agent, aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-delivery-agent, aidlc-architect-agent,
aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-developer-agent,
aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, aidlc-operations-agent.

The two review-only agents run independent checks when stage frontmatter names
a reviewer; see [Reviewer Invocation](#reviewer-invocation). The composer
proposes and reshapes adaptive stage plans instead of leading domain stage
work. See the full [Agent Reference](agents/README.md).

## Error Recovery

*(Protocol Section 6)*

### Resume Context

When `aidlc-state.md` exists at session start, the conductor reads it to
determine completed stages (`[x]`), current/next stage, and artifact
existence, then offers to resume from the last incomplete stage.

### Resume Context Loading by Phase

| Phase/Stage Group | Context to Load |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Initialization (0.1-0.3)** | Workspace filesystem; `aidlc-state.md` |
| **Ideation (1.1-1.7)** | `<record>/ideation/` artifacts; guardrails |
| **Inception -- RE** | Per-repo RE artifacts at `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/codekb/<repo>/`; ideation scope/feasibility |
| **Inception -- Practices Discovery** | Preserve the lead draft and existing contribution files; dispatch only missing quality/developer/devsecops spokes, then continue with the human interview and lead integration |
| **Inception -- Requirements** | Per-repo `codekb/` artifacts (if performed); requirements-analysis docs |
| **Inception -- Design** | Requirements; user stories; domain-design docs |
| **Inception -- Delivery Planning** | All inception artifacts; delivery-planning if partial |
| **Construction -- Code Gen** | Current unit's design artifacts, story design, acceptance criteria, prior code |
| **Construction -- Build/Test** | Current unit's code, test plans, acceptance criteria, build config |
| **Construction -- CI/Infra** | Infrastructure design; code generation outputs |
| **Operation (4.1-4.7)** | Construction outputs; operation artifacts so far; for 4.4+, deployment outputs from 4.1-4.3 |

### Re-run Behavior

If a stage needs re-run (changes requested after approval):
1. Re-read stage file
2. Load prior artifacts as context
3. Execute again, overwriting previous artifacts
4. Present new completion message

### Compaction Recovery

`PreCompact` hook validates `aidlc-state.md` structure before compaction
(informational-only, cannot block). Writes `.aidlc-recovery.md` breadcrumb
with last validated state (stage, timestamp). On resume, the conductor compares
breadcrumb with state file to detect compaction-related corruption.

### Corrupted State File Recovery

If `aidlc-state.md` exists but cannot be parsed:
1. Backup to `aidlc-state.md.bak`
2. Scan `<record>/` for artifacts to determine actual completion:
   - RE analysis files -> RE stages complete
   - Requirement docs -> requirements complete
   - Design docs -> design complete
   - Code matching story designs -> code gen complete
3. Rebuild state from artifact evidence
4. Set "Current Status" to first stage lacking evidence
5. Inform user: "State file was corrupted. Rebuilt from artifacts. Please verify."

### Missing Artifact Recovery

If a stage references artifacts that do not exist on disk:
1. List missing artifacts
2. Check if producing stage is marked complete
3. If complete but missing: inform user, offer re-run or manual provision
4. If not complete: run stage normally

### Contradictory Inputs Recovery

If user inputs from different stages contradict:
1. Flag specific contradiction with quotes from both sources
2. Do NOT resolve by choosing one interpretation
3. Ask which takes priority
4. Update overridden artifact
5. Log resolution in the `audit/` shards

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Examples | Action |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Cannot continue | Corrupted state, missing critical artifacts, unrecoverable parse errors | Stop, ask user immediately |
| **High** | Output may be wrong | Contradictory inputs, incomplete answers, missing dependencies | Stop, ask user immediately |
| **Medium** | Quality reduced | Vague responses, partial context, ambiguous requirements | Attempt resolution; if unresolved, ask user |
| **Low** | Cosmetic | Formatting, naming, style issues | Handle silently, log in the `audit/` shards |

---

## Change Handling

Five categories of mid-workflow changes, each with different handling.

*(Protocol Section 7)*

### Minor Changes

Affect only current stage. Apply changes to artifacts, re-present completion
message. No rollback needed.

### Major Changes

Affect prior stages:
1. Identify affected prior stages
2. Present impact analysis via `AskUserQuestion`
3. If approved, re-run affected stages in order
4. Re-enter and complete them through orchestrator directives and reports; do
   not edit lifecycle checkboxes directly

### Scope Changes

New requirements or scope-level modifications:
1. Document in the `audit/` shards
2. Return to Requirements Analysis (2.3) or Delivery Planning (2.9)
3. Re-plan from that point
4. If change affects stage selection (e.g., `poc` -> `feature`), use the
   scope/recompose command so the engine updates the plan atomically

### Unit Changes

| Change | Procedure |
|--------|-----------|
| **Add** | Add to plan, create story design, slot into build order. Do NOT re-run completed units. |
| **Remove** | Mark skipped, archive artifacts. Check dependencies -- flag impact on dependents. |
| **Split** | Archive original, create two entries, distribute stories, run story design for each. |

### Architectural Changes

Affect application architecture (switching DBs, deployment model, major
integration):
1. Identify scope: affected design artifacts, story designs, generated code
2. Present full impact analysis
3. If approved, return to App Design stage and re-run from there
4. Regenerate all downstream artifacts for affected units
5. Preserve unaffected units

### Archive Before Change

Before any major change overwriting artifacts:
1. Create `<record>/archive/` if needed
2. Copy affected artifacts to `<record>/archive/[ISO-date]-[stage-name]/`
3. Proceed. No prior work permanently lost.

---

## Depth Guidance

Create exactly the detail needed -- no more, no less. Depth adapts to scope
and problem complexity.

*(Protocol Section 8)*

### Scope-to-Depth and Test Strategy Defaults

| Scope | Default Depth | Test Strategy | Typical Stages | Notes |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------------:|-------|
| enterprise | Comprehensive | Comprehensive | 33 | All stages |
| feature | Standard | Standard | 33 | All stages |
| mvp | Standard | Standard | 23 | Skip all Operation |
| poc | Minimal | Minimal | ~8 | Initialization + Ideation + core Inception |
| bugfix | Minimal | Minimal | 9 | Targeted |
| refactor | Minimal | Minimal | 10 | Targeted |
| infra | Standard | Standard | ~13 | Infra-focused |
| security-patch | Minimal | Minimal | ~10 | Security-focused |
| classic | Standard | Standard | 26 | Default v1-style lifecycle without Ideation |
| workshop | Standard | Minimal | 26 | Facilitated lifecycle with teaching test floor |
| express | Minimal | Minimal | 10 | Requirements to conditional deploy, reviewers disabled |

User can override depth or test strategy at any approval gate.

### Three Depth Levels

**Minimal** (poc, bugfix, refactor, security-patch, express) -- minimal artifacts,
brief analysis, skip optional stages:
- Requirements: 5-10 items, brief descriptions, minimal NFRs
- App Design: single component diagram, basic data model, no ADRs
- Functional Design: brief business rules, simple entities, skip
  `frontend-components.md`

**Standard** (feature, mvp, infra, classic, workshop) -- full artifacts at moderate detail:
- Requirements: 15-30 with acceptance criteria, moderate NFRs
- App Design: component diagrams with interactions, relationships, 2-3 ADRs
- Functional Design: detailed business logic, comprehensive rules, entity
  lifecycle

**Comprehensive** (enterprise) -- deep analysis, all stages execute:
- Requirements: 30+, detailed criteria, comprehensive NFRs across all
  categories
- App Design: multi-layer diagrams, detailed data flow, integration sequences,
  5+ ADRs with alternatives
- Functional Design: decision trees, state machines, concurrency, error
  recovery, cross-unit patterns

## Content Validation

*(Protocol Section 10)*

### Mermaid Rules

Before writing any Mermaid diagram:
1. Verify syntax (balanced braces, valid nodes/edges, no unescaped specials)
2. Ensure all referenced nodes are declared
3. Include text fallback: `<!-- Text fallback: [description] -->`

### Pre-Creation Checklist

Before creating any artifact:
- All referenced entities exist in prior artifacts
- No naming conflicts with existing artifacts
- File path matches stage convention

### ASCII Diagram Standards

Use only basic ASCII: `+` `-` `|` `^` `v` `<` `>` `/` `\` plus
alphanumerics and spaces. Prohibited: Unicode box-drawing (U+2500-U+257F).
Character-width rule: every line in a box must have equal character count.

Reference patterns:
```
+------------------+       +---------------------------+
| Component Name   |       | Outer                     |
+------------------+       |  +-----+  +-----+        |
                           |  | A   |  | B   |        |
[Source] -----> [Target]   |  +-----+  +-----+        |
[Source] <----> [Target]   +---------------------------+
```

### Character Escaping

| Character | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Pipe (`\|`) | Escape inside table cells |
| Angle brackets | Escape when not HTML tags |
| Code fences | Triple backtick with language identifier |
| Mermaid labels | Wrap special characters in quotes |

---

## Subagent Return Summary

When a subagent completes, it must return a structured summary to the
conductor to ensure no context is lost.

*(Conditional module: `stage-protocol-ensemble.md`, Section 11)*

### Required Format

```markdown
## Subagent Summary: [Stage Name]
### Produced
- [file path]: [brief description]
### Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [rationale]
### Issues / Concerns
- [Problems, edge cases, risks] or "None"
### Next Steps
- [What orchestrator should do next]
```

**Conductor rules:** Must read summary before proceeding. Non-empty
Issues/Concerns must be presented to user. Fewer files than expected requires
investigation before marking complete.

### Context Budget

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Current-unit only | Pass only current unit's design artifacts |
| Summarize inception | 1-2 line summary per inception artifact with path; subagent Reads if needed |
| Always include | Specific task instructions and relevant state/artifact paths; the harness agent config loads persona and knowledge |
| Large knowledge sets | Name especially relevant file paths; do not paste persona or knowledge prose into the prompt |

### Failure Recovery

1. **Retry once** with reduced context (summarize inception, current unit only)
2. If retry fails, offer user: "Run inline" (execute in orchestrator) or
   "Skip and revisit" (mark incomplete, continue)
3. Log failure in the `audit/` shards using Error log format

---

## Reviewer Invocation

When a `run-stage` directive carries a non-null `reviewer` field, the conductor
invokes that reviewer as a **separate sub-agent** after the stage body produces its
artifacts and before the §13 Learnings Ritual and the approval gate. The stage
ritual sequence in full: questions → artifact → reviewer (if declared) →
learnings → gate.

*(Conditional module: `stage-protocol-reviewer.md`, Section 12a)*

The directive's `review_class` field selects the contract, resolved by the
engine from three inputs (low-wins): the stage's declared class, the active
scope's `review_cap`, and any per-run `--review` override. A `none` resolution
omits the reviewer block entirely and the stage runs reviewless.

1. **Invoke.** Before every dispatch - the first, a NOT-READY re-invoke, or a
   re-review after a Part 0 gate-rejection revision - the conductor first
   records the review request. The logger captures every declared artifact
   through one stable file-identity snapshot, binds the request to exactly
   those bytes plus the workspace and per-Unit source fingerprints where
   applicable, mints a `Request Id`, and returns `requestId` and `reviewFile`
   in its JSON: the project-relative path under the intent record's
   `.aidlc-reviews/` directory where this request's review is written. The
   request opens that slot (a draft left by an earlier incomplete dispatch of
   the same iteration is removed). The directive's `review_artifact` field
   names the required Markdown output the review is about: the record is
   keyed to it, the gate names it, and finding selectors address it; output
   ordering and plugin additions cannot change it, and nothing writes to it
   during a review. On a re-dispatch the conductor first runs
   `aidlc-review-brief.ts context --stage <slug>` (plus `--unit` where
   applicable) and retains its hydrated findings as the prior-review context,
   then delegates to the agent named in `directive.reviewer`, passing the
   `reviewFile` path as the one file the reviewer writes. The gate and
   completion remain blocked while the request is unmatched. The reviewer
   receives the stage definition path, Q&A file, produced artifact paths, and
   validation tools from frontmatter - never the builder's `memory.md` or
   plan, so it forms independent judgment. A retry reuses the original
   artifact/source binding and request id and never rebaselines current bytes.
   The review freeze stays on throughout a stale-receipt recovery: the reviewer
   writes beside the artifact, never inside it, so no write window is needed.
2. **Review.** An `adversarial` review runs under the adversarial review contract:
   the reviewer tries to refute the artifact rather than confirm it, grounding
   findings in machine-checkable evidence where it exists (READY is the verdict
   it fails to reach, not the default). An `advisory` review keeps the
   evidence-grounding rule but is a single normal-flow decision-support pass: findings are
   ranked by severity for the human at the gate, with no repair loop behind
   them. Either way the reviewer reads the definition, Q&A, and artifacts, runs
   any listed validation tools, and writes exactly ONE file: its review, at the
   `reviewFile` path. The review contains one matching Verdict, Reviewer, and
   Iteration line, its findings table, and no second H2 section; the reviewer
   writes nothing else, in particular not the artifact it reviews. The request
   binds artifact bytes and workspace source before dispatch; retry cannot
   rebaseline either, and completion uses one stable file-identity snapshot.
   The reviewers run under a hard turn budget (`maxTurns: 60`),
   authored once in the persona frontmatter and enforced natively where the
   harness has a lever: Claude Code reads the key verbatim (the sub-agent is
   stopped mid-task, no final-message turn) and the opencode packager projects
   it to the native per-agent `steps: 60` (the runner grants one final
   text-only turn - a summary can return, but no tool call can write the
   review). Codex TOML personas, Cursor, Copilot, and Kiro CLI/IDE expose no
   per-agent cap key, so there the budget is persona prose only (the personas'
   `## Turn Budget` section plans for the worst-case cutoff on every harness).
3. **Verdict and decision brief.** The conductor records the verdict with the
   same `aidlc-log.ts review` command plus `--verdict`. The logger reads the
   review from the request's `reviewFile` (or `--review-file <path>`),
   validates it, proves the dispatched artifact bytes and request-time source
   identity are unchanged, and writes the review record
   `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/stage/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` or
   `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/units/<unit>/<attempt>/<iteration>.json`
   (verdict, findings, reviewer, request id, artifact and source fingerprints,
   review text) in the same locked transaction as the `REVIEW_COMPLETED` row
   that names it and pins its digest. Only this command writes a record; a
   record edited afterwards no longer hashes to its row and is not the review.
   On `advisory`, both verdicts are terminal in
   normal flow: the workflow proceeds to the learnings ritual and the gate.
   Before that gate, `aidlc-review-brief.ts review --stage <slug> --why
   <first|revision|stale>` renders the exact stage, ordinary-language outcome,
   review artifact(s), hydrated findings from the record, decision effects, and
   concrete upstream/downstream invalidation paths (`reviewer_max_iterations`
   is 1, engine-enforced). The final gate of a per-Unit stage renders every Unit
   covered by that single approval; Unit filtering remains limited to reviewer
   dispatch context.
   On `adversarial`: READY → proceed to the learnings ritual then the gate.
   NOT-READY with iterations remaining below `reviewer_max_iterations` (default
   2) → the lead agent re-runs to address the findings and the reviewer
   re-checks. NOT-READY with iterations exhausted → proceed to the gate with the
   unresolved findings noted.
   A verdict only counts when the review file parses as exactly ONE review with
   matching canonical identity fields. A missing file (a capped or crashed
   reviewer is stopped without writing one - the request opened an empty slot,
   so a leftover draft can never stand in for it), a review without a canonical
   verdict line, or duplicated verdicts is an INCOMPLETE attempt: the conductor
   retries the same unmatched request once with `--retry-pending` (no iteration
   consumed - an advisory normal-flow budget is exactly one pass, so a counted
   cut-off would exhaust it without any review happening), and a second
   incomplete attempt records the terminal receipt `--verdict NOT-READY` with no
   review file and the brief's fallback finding "review did not complete within
   its turn budget" - the gate is reached with a concrete finding, never
   presented on (or deadlocked by) a silently missing verdict.
   On `adversarial` with iterations remaining the re-invoke skips the lead
   (the artifact was never reviewed; there is nothing for the builder to act
   on).
   The review request is accepted only after the consolidated answers are
   confirmed, every verifiable required output document exists, and any
   per-Unit stage with a resolvable authoritative Unit set names only Units
   present in that set. An unresolvable set does not refuse the request:
   named-Unit outputs remain mandatory, while a stage-level request skips the
   all-Unit output enumeration it cannot verify. A stage-level request on a
   per-Unit stage with a resolved set covers every authoritative Unit, so every
   Unit's applicable required outputs must exist. The recorded receipt is terminal
   whenever no further review pass follows it: any later output document write
   means the review no longer covers the current document, so fixes happen
   inside the iteration loop, never after the terminal receipt.
   Suggestions riding on a verdict are quoted at the gate for the human, not
   applied. If a final review already exists and the document genuinely needs
   changes, Request Changes can be recorded while the stage is active or
   awaiting approval; `[R]` restarts through `/aidlc --stage <slug>`, and `[x]`
   requires restoring the reviewed source state or jumping back to redo it.

Reviews recorded before review records existed live as a terminal `## Review`
section inside `review_artifact`. Those sections stay readable: the gate brief
and the redispatch context render them when no record exists for the scope, and
the Plan Approval projection still strips one from the plan. A reviewer that
still appends one is tolerated for this release cycle only (deprecated): the
logger accepts the section as the verdict when it provably postdates the
request, copies that validated section into the review record, and removes the
embedded input form in the next minor release. The protocol writes no new
embedded section; the old section stays as inert content.

Human finding dispositions never rewrite the terminally reviewed artifact.
`GATE_APPROVED` atomically records `Accepted risk` for each current New or
Unresolved finding. A Request Changes report records `Rejected: <reason>` only
for explicit
`--reject-finding <review-artifact>#R-NN=<exact human reason>` values; generic
revision feedback leaves findings unresolved. The renderer folds these
content-addressed audit records into later gates and re-review dispatches.

The iteration budget is engine-enforced: `aidlc-log.ts review` refuses a
request whose `--iteration` exceeds the stage's effective budget, so
a conductor that loses count cannot run unbounded review passes. The only
exception is a terminal receipt invalidated by a later `produces[]` write: the
first request after stale evidence is exactly one marked recovery request at
the next ordinal, even when normal adversarial budget remained. Either
recovery verdict is terminal; a second invalidation requires human reset
instead of another request. Autonomous Units halt before `finalize` and
restart their Bolt attempt only after a human decision. The reviewer
never blocks — the human always has final say at the gate — and does not fire
for stages without a `reviewer` field. See the `reviewer` /
`reviewer_max_iterations` / `review_class` frontmatter fields in
[Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md).

If reviewer dispatch fails, times out, ends the session after the request but
before a verdict, or returns an incomplete attempt (no review file, or no
single canonical verdict), rerun the same
request command with `--retry-pending` before dispatching again - at most once
per request; a second incomplete attempt records the terminal `NOT-READY`
receipt instead. The logger accepts this recovery only for the same unmatched
request, records `Retry: pending-request`, and does not consume another
iteration. A completed request cannot be retried; stale-receipt recovery is a
distinct request at the next ordinal.

---

## Learnings Ritual

When a human corrects agent behavior, the correction can become a persistent
rule (guardrail) for the next workflow. v0.5.0 handles this through the
tool-as-actor Learnings Ritual, not a separate guardrail-emission flow.

*(Protocol Section 13)*

The ritual runs at every gated stage, between the completion message and the
approval gate:

1. **Diary**: the agent maintains a per-stage `memory.md` (Interpretations /
   Deviations / Tradeoffs / Open questions) as it works.
2. **Surface**: `aidlc-learnings.ts surface --slug <slug>` reads the diary and
   emits structured candidates — the LLM does not re-parse or classify.
3. **Confirm**: the conductor renders the candidates; the user picks which to
   keep and, for free-text additions, picks the heading that derives the
   destination. The always-present "Anything to add?" channel renders at least
   `Nothing to add` and `Add a note`; one-option structured questions are
   invalid on Claude Code and Codex.
4. **Admission check**: each kept learning is checked against `org.md`'s
   matching section; a contradiction is surfaced to revise / skip / escalate.
5. **Persist**: `aidlc-learnings.ts persist` writes each confirmed learning as a practice to
   `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{project,team}.md` (and, for a sensor-binding
   learning, installs the manifest + stage `sensors:` import in one locked
   transaction), emitting `RULE_LEARNED` / `SENSOR_PROPOSED`.

Learnings apply on the **next** workflow's compile, not the in-flight run. See
`stage-protocol.md` §13 for the full tool-as-actor protocol, and
[Rule System](08-rule-system.md) for the strict-additive resolution the written
rules feed into.

---

## Phase Boundary Verification

At each phase transition, traceability verification ensures completed-phase
outputs are sufficient and consistent for the next phase.

*(`stage-protocol-governance.md` Section 13 — distinct from the Learnings
Ritual, which is `stage-protocol.md` Section 13)*

### Triggers

- After last stage of each phase is approved
- Before first stage of next phase begins
- On demand via `/aidlc --status`

### Process

1. Read methodology from `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-shared/verification.md`
2. Run phase-specific traceability checks
3. Write results to `<record>/verification/[phase-boundary]-verification.md`
4. If failed: present issues (missing links, orphaned artifacts,
   inconsistencies) before proceeding
5. Log `PHASE_VERIFIED` to the `audit/` shards

### Per-Phase Checks

| Boundary | Verified |
|----------|---------|
| **Ideation -> Inception** | Intent captured, scope defined, feasibility confirmed, initiative approved |
| **Inception -> Construction** | All requirements traced to designs, units defined, delivery plan approved |
| **Construction -> Operation** | All units built/tested, CI pipeline configured, infrastructure designed |

### Traceability Matrix

The verification ensures a traceable chain:
```
Intent -> Scope -> Requirements -> Designs -> Units -> Code -> Tests -> Deployment
```

At each boundary, every artifact on the left must have a corresponding
artifact on the right. Missing links, orphans, and inconsistencies are flagged
for user review.
