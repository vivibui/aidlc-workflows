# The Orchestration Engine and Skill System

> Audience: Tier 2/3 (team adopter, framework contributor).

This chapter is the canonical reference for the orchestration architecture that drives every `/aidlc` run: a deterministic **engine** (`aidlc-orchestrate.ts`) that answers "what's next?", a thin **conductor** (`skills/aidlc/SKILL.md`) that acts on the engine's answer, the **typed directive contract** that joins them, the **plural skill** set the runner generator emits, the **scope shape** that decides which stages run, and the **swarm** referee that converges parallel Construction work. It replaces the older prose-orchestrator model, where the `SKILL.md` body itself held all the routing logic. Cross-link to [Orchestrator](03-orchestrator.md) (the conductor's own chapter), [Runtime Graph](13-runtime-graph.md) (the execution-truth mirror the engine and swarm read), [State Machine](12-state-machine.md) (the transitions `report` commits), and [Hooks and Tools](06-hooks-and-tools.md) (the deterministic spine, including the Stop hook).

## 1. The engine and the conductor

The cutover splits one concern into two. The **engine** owns *between-stage routing* — scope resolution, the flag-precedence ladder, jump-direction computation, resume and init guards, stage sequencing, gate status, and workflow completion. The **conductor** owns *execution quality inside the move the engine named* — framing the persona, asking good questions, keeping the stage diary, the intra-stage Keep/Modify/Redo loop, and surfacing judgement to the human at gates.

The engine is authored at `core/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts` and ships into each harness as `<harness-dir>/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts` (e.g. `.claude/tools/`); it is a Bun CLI with exactly five subcommands: `next`, `continue`, `report`, `park`, and `team-board`. `continue` is internal steering transport; `team-board` is the read-only Team Construction query.

| Subcommand | Role | Mutates state? |
|------------|------|----------------|
| `next` | Read the workflow state (the active intent's `aidlc-state.md`, under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`) and the compiled stage graph (`tools/data/stage-graph.json`), resolve scope and position, and emit **exactly one** typed directive (JSON) to stdout. | No workflow-state mutation and no authority mutation: `next` never mints, rotates, or clears a Plan Approval receipt, challenge, or fingerprint. It is also idempotent - when the active-directive marker already records this exact directive for this state, it returns that directive verbatim and writes nothing, so re-asking never restarts rule delivery or moves an approval. `next --single` records only its synthetic `STAGE_STARTED` audit boundary before emitting work; an ordinary team dispatcher read may refresh the gitignored local claim-observation cache and generation stamps, while Stop-hook and route-check probes write nothing at all beyond the advisory engine-turn marker, and a durable write from either fails loudly instead of proceeding. A no-state creation over a workspace that already holds intents emits an intent-pick prompt instead of creating a duplicate. |
| `report` | Commit the transition after the conductor acted on a directive. A stage-aware dispatcher: `--stage <slug>` pins the acted directive so a recovered `Current Stage` cannot make the report target drift. It owns approval, rejection, revision, completion, and skip outcomes, dispatching internal state transitions atomically and opening a missing gate before approval when the explicitly reported stage is still `[-]`. | Yes. |
| `team-board` | Render the pure Team Construction board used by the terminal main dispatcher and `/aidlc --status`. Internal query surface; no fetch and no state/cache mutation. | No. |
| `park` | Pause an active workflow at a clean inter-stage boundary. It writes the `Parked` marker that makes subsequent `next` calls emit a terminal `parked` directive; `/aidlc --resume` clears the marker before routing resumes. | Yes. |

`report --result skipped` is a main-workflow lifecycle outcome, not a
single-run outcome. It requires an explicit nonblank `--stage`, a nonblank
`--reason`, the named stage to equal `Current Stage`, and the stage to be
active or revising. The engine records one `STAGE_SKIPPED`, preserves `[S]`,
and starts the next stage (or completes the workflow) without emitting
`STAGE_COMPLETED`. `report --single --result skipped` is rejected. Conductors
never invoke the corresponding `aidlc-state.ts` lifecycle verb directly.

`next --stage <slug> --single` first records `STAGE_STARTED` under
`single-stage:<slug>`, then emits a `run-stage` with `single: true`,
`gate: false`, and `next_stage: null`. That typed marker overrides normal gate
handling: the conductor runs the body, configured topology and reviewer, then
calls `report --single --stage <slug> --result completed` exactly once. Report
requires the open start boundary and records the matching `STAGE_COMPLETED`; it
does not fabricate both rows. The isolated path does not run workflow learnings,
open an approval gate, call main-workflow `next`, or park. The returned `done`
terminates the isolated run.

The engine is deterministic code by design — routing is the determinism concern, so it lives in a tool, never in LLM prose (handing route string-building to an LLM would invert the tool/agent/human thesis). It **composes** the existing deterministic library: `loadGraph()` for the compiled graph, `nextInScopeStage()` / `firstInScopeStageOfPhase()` for sequencing, `validScopes()` for the scope-name set, and `getField` / `parseCheckboxes` for state reads. The non-happy-path branches (jump, intent creation, scope/config change, env-scope validation) compose the sibling CLI tools by shelling out and relaying their stderr verbatim, so user-facing error wording is never reconstructed. Explicit resume falls through to normal continuation after its parked/no-state guards. The only things the engine *adds* rather than composes are the decision rule mapping `(observed state + graph) → directive kind` and the artifact-path resolver that turns the graph node's vocabulary names into canonical record-dir paths (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/<phase>/<stage>/...`).

Every directive is validated against the frozen contract in `aidlc-directive.ts` before it is printed; a malformed directive exits non-zero rather than emitting a lie the conductor would act on.

---

## 2. The typed directive contract

`aidlc-directive.ts` defines a discriminated union over **eleven** directive kinds, keyed on the `kind` field. Each directive carries exactly the fields its kind needs, enforced by per-kind allowed-key sets (a field outside its kind's set is rejected as an unknown key). The engine **emits nine kinds today**; two are documented placeholders that keep the loop complete-shaped until later waves wire them.

| `kind` | Emitted today? | What the conductor does |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `print` | Yes | Do exactly what `directive.message` says — it is authoritative. Three shapes: **terminal** (names a read-only utility such as status/help/doctor/version; run it, print stdout verbatim, STOP), **run-then-continue** (names a mutating tool such as a scope change, a jump `execute`, or fresh-workspace `intent-create`; run it, then return to step 1), and **run-then-stop** (a confirmed `--new-intent` creation; run `intent-create`, STOP, and hand off using the harness-specific fresh-session flow without re-running `next`). The mutation lives in the named tool, never in `next`. |
| `error` | Yes | Print `directive.message` verbatim and STOP. Do not recover or smooth it over — the message is the user-facing error. |
| `done` | Yes | The workflow (or single-stage run) is complete. Present the completion summary and STOP. |
| `parked` | Yes | The workflow was parked mid-flow at a clean inter-stage boundary (`directive.stage`) for a later session. Tell the user it is parked and how to resume (`/aidlc --resume`), then STOP. Emitted on a plain `next` while a `Parked` marker is set (written by `aidlc-orchestrate park`); no stage is advanced. The Stop hook treats `parked` as a terminal allow, so the conductor parks instead of rubber-stamping stages to reach `done` (#367). |
| `notice` | Yes | Print `directive.message` verbatim and STOP. This is a terminal informational hand-off, used on unscoped main while team-owned Units are claimed elsewhere; it does not advance or mutate the workflow. |
| `load-steering` | Yes | Apply `rules_content` in order, retain it as the active stage's rule bundle, and immediately invoke `aidlc-orchestrate continue <continue_token>`. Do not report or narrate chunk progress. |
| `run-stage` | Yes | The preceding `load-steering` sequence delivered every substantive active-space rule. Treat `inline_context_paths` as a blocking load list, not delivered content: explicitly read every required entry and wait for its contents before reading the stage file/consumes, initializing the diary, running the body, dispatching mob supports, or writing artifacts. A mob loads its lead persona first. Show any `context_warnings` and continue with the readable persona/knowledge roster. On dispatched topologies, paste the accumulated rule bundle verbatim into every agent brief. Branch on optional `directive.single`, then optional `directive.wave`, then optional `directive.unit_gate`, before ordinary `directive.gate`. A Unit gate is gate-only work whose body/reviewer already settled and whose reports include `--unit`; a wave contains complete engine-resolved Unit entries and settles each through paired review evidence plus `unit complete --wave`. The directive also carries the resolved routing fields straight off the graph node. |
| `ask` | Yes | Render `directive.question` via the harness's structured-question surface, then follow its typed response contract. Ordinary asks return through `report --user-input`; `ask_type: "new-work-routing"` carries `response_route: "next"`, `new_work_description`, and `proposed_scope`, so its continue / separate-work / reshape answer routes through `next` and never through `report`. `ask_type: "unit-claim"` carries `response_route: "claim"` plus claimable, claimed, and dependency-blocked Unit rows; choosing a Unit runs `/aidlc --claim <unit>` and stops on that command's result. `ask_type: "guard-recovery"` carries `response_route: "execute-remedy"`, the refusing stage and Unit, `reason_codes`, and `remedies`, each with a closed `op`: the conductor offers the remedies whose `executableNow` is true, waits for the human, and executes exactly the selected `command` or follows its `action`; an empty `remedies` list with a `state_signature` is the terminal shape, rendered verbatim with no engine action until the human answers (see [Guard admission and recovery asks](12-state-machine.md#guard-admission-and-recovery-asks)). The engine never asks the human itself — it defers the turn to the conductor. |
| `invoke-swarm` | Yes | The engine granted an eligible Construction batch to the swarm. The conductor fans out the units in `directive.units` and runs the convergence loop, consulting the swarm referee (see §6). Emitted only for an eligible Construction batch under an `autonomous` grant. |
| `dispatch-subagent` | No (engine-future placeholder) | *Would* run the named stage via a `Task` call rather than inline. Not emitted today; do not implement speculatively. |
| `present-gate` | No (engine-future placeholder) | *Would* run the gate ritual as its own directive; today the gate decision is folded into `run-stage`'s `gate` field. |

**The gate sentinel.** `run-stage`'s `gate` is a boolean for every deterministic case (`false` for the auto-proceeding bootstrap initialization stages, `true` for every other EXECUTE stage). One case is not deterministic: the first Construction Bolt's gate depends on the team's free-form `## Walking Skeleton` practices prose, which no parser can derive. The engine emits the string sentinel `GATE_UNRESOLVED` (`"unresolved"`) and defers the classification to the conductor's knowledge-work, which hands the stance back via `report --skeleton-stance <on|off|scope-dependent>`; the next `next` re-emits the same stage with a now-determined boolean gate.

**The conductor persona delivery.** The conductor's execution-quality charter lives once at `aidlc-common/conductor.md`. No skill references it by path. Instead the engine reads it and bakes its contents into the `conductor_persona` field of the **first `run-stage` directive of the workflow**. When the conductor receives that field, it adopts the persona for the whole run. This keeps every entry point — framework runner and hand-written alike — on one persona with no per-skill diligence.

---

## 3. The forwarding loop and the Stop hook

`skills/aidlc/SKILL.md` is the **conductor**: a thin forwarding loop that acts on the engine's directives. Its whole control structure is:

```
Loop:
  1. directive = `aidlc engine orchestrate next $ARGUMENTS`
  2. act on directive.kind
  3. `aidlc engine orchestrate report --stage <directive.stage> --result <outcome> [--user-input "<text>"]` when the directive names a stage; omit `--stage` only for non-stage report round-trips.
  4. repeat unless directive.kind == done
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["next $ARGUMENTS"] --> B{"directive.kind"}
  B -->|"run-stage / ask / invoke-swarm"| C["conductor acts on the move"]
  C --> D["report --stage ... --result ..."]
  D --> A
  B -->|"print (run-then-continue)"| C
  B -->|"print (terminal) / error / done / parked / notice"| E["STOP"]
```

Text description of the diagram: `next` (passed `$ARGUMENTS` verbatim) returns one directive. The conductor branches on `directive.kind`. For `run-stage`, ordinary `ask`, `invoke-swarm`, and run-then-continue `print` directives it performs the named move and calls `report`, which loops back to `next`. A typed `new-work-routing` ask loops through its declared `next` route instead; a typed `unit-claim` ask routes the selected Unit through `claim`. For terminal `print`, `error`, `done`, `parked`, and `notice` it stops the loop.

`$ARGUMENTS` passes through to the first `next` verbatim — the engine parses the flags (`--status`, `--stage`, `--scope`, `--depth`, freeform text), so the conductor never pre-parses or strips them. Because `next` mutates nothing, the loop only advances when `report` commits a transition, so the next `next` always reads fresh state.

On the interactive path the conductor holds the loop, because only it can ask the human a question. To keep the loop from resting on the LLM's good behaviour, the **Stop hook** (`hooks/aidlc-continue-workflow.ts`) enforces it deterministically. It is one of six flow-altering hooks; deliver-stage-rules, plan-approval, state-transition, reviewer-scope, and review-freeze are the five PreToolUse controls, while the remaining ten hooks are advisory. When the conductor tries to end its turn, the Stop hook runs `aidlc-orchestrate next`; if a directive is still pending, it blocks the stop and injects the directive back via the `reason` field, phrased as an **on-task continuation** (it names the work still owed - run the loop, act, report - never an override-shaped instruction, which the conductor's safety training would refuse). Probe `next` calls write nothing: no directive publication, no claim-observation refresh, no Plan Approval state. A `done`, `parked`, or informational `notice` directive allows the stop; `parked` is the supported mid-flow pause for a later session, while `notice` is a write-free team fan-out hand-off. Some pending cases are *not* blocked either: a **human-wait carve-out** allows the stop when the conductor is correctly parked on the human (or simply chatting) - the current stage is positively `[?]` awaiting-approval, `[R]` revising, `[-]` in-progress with either an unanswered `[Answer]:` tag in its canonical or exact active-unit `<slug>-questions.md` or a current-stage `DECISION_RECORDED` with no later `QUESTION_ANSWERED`, or the ending turn was conversational (the human's last prompt was answered with no workflow-engine call, read from the harness transcript; a read-only `--status`/`--doctor` query does not count as engagement). Logged decisions and conversational turns are suppressed under autonomous Construction; file-backed questions are also suppressed except that unit-major code-generation's exact mandatory Plan Approval question still releases the turn. The conversational case is inert on Kiro, which delivers no transcript, where the interactive cap is the release path instead. Blocking there would only spam the nudge (positive-confirmation only; the human-wait checks fail open and the conversational check fails closed; stateless cases and a genuine mid-stage quit still block). Two bounds keep a stuck loop from trapping the session: Claude Code's `stop_hook_active` signal, and a no-progress counter persisted under `<record>/.aidlc-stop-hook/` (in the active intent's record dir). Once consecutive no-progress blocks reach the ceiling (`CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`, whose default is run-mode aware: **2 in an interactive run and 8 under autonomous Construction**) the hook lets go; a workflow advance changes the position signature and resets the counter to 0, so a healthy loop is never throttled. With no active workflow, or on any unexpected error, the hook fails open - it never blocks a non-AIDLC session.

## 4. Plural skills, runners, and the shared spine

The orchestrator is one skill among many. Each harness ships a plural set under its installed skills directory (`<harness-dir>/skills/`, e.g. `.claude/skills/`): the base `aidlc` orchestrator, one **stage-runner** per runnable stage (core stages use `aidlc-<slug>`; plugin-owned stages use their bare plugin-prefixed slug), one **scope-runner** per `runner: true` scope (core scopes use `aidlc-<scope>`; plugin-owned scopes use their bare name), the read-only session skills (`aidlc-session-cost`, `aidlc-replay`, `aidlc-outcomes-pack`), and `aidlc-init`. All of the routing-and-execution knowledge lives once in the **shared spine** authored at `core/aidlc-common/` (shipped as `<harness-dir>/aidlc-common/`): the `conductor.md` persona, the `protocols/`, and the 33 stage files under `stages/{initialization,ideation,inception,construction,operation}/`.

The runner skills are generated, never hand-written, by `tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts`:

- **Stage-runners** are opt-in sugar. Each core `/aidlc-<slug>` (or plugin-owned `/<plugin>-<slug>`) packages `/aidlc --stage <slug> --single` (which works without it) into a typeable command that runs one stage in isolation via the engine's `--single` mode and never advances the main workflow's `Current Stage`. `next --single` owns the synthetic start, the emitted `single: true` directive bypasses workflow learnings and approval gates, and `report --single` owns the matching completion before the runner stops on `done`. The slug list comes from `loadGraph()` — the one compiled source of truth — so a stage added to the graph flows into a runner with no edit here. The bootstrap initialization stages are excluded (they have no standalone `--single` meaning; `--single` refuses them), and the whole initialization phase ships as one `/aidlc-init` runner that packages the engine's `intent-create` move.
- **Scope-runners** package an already-runnable command; the scope file holds the definition and opts into the default generated set with `runner: true`. Each is a short shell that drives `aidlc-orchestrate next --scope <scope>` to `done` with a fixed scope and no detection. The full scope set stays reachable via `/aidlc --scope <name>`; runners are typeable sugar over the high-traffic ones and any plugin scope that opts in.

Two drift guards keep the on-disk runner sets pinned to their sources: `aidlc-runner-gen.ts check` for stage-runners and `scopes --check` for scope-runners, both run in CI. Runners carry **no `hooks:` block** — the workflow-spine hooks live project-wide in `settings.json`, so the deterministic spine is inherited, not copied. And no runner loads `conductor.md` by hand: the engine delivers the persona on the first `next`.

---

## 5. Scope shape

Scope is a file-authored primitive, the same muscle memory as authoring a sensor or an agent. There is **no `scope-mapping.json`** — it has been removed from the shipped tree. Scope identity and stage membership are split across two file-authored surfaces, transposed into a compiled grid:

1. **Identity** is authored in one file per scope at `core/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` and projected to `<harness-dir>/scopes/` — frontmatter (required `name` and `depth`, plus optional `keywords`, `description`, `testStrategy`, `review_cap`, and `runner`) plus prose describing the scope. The shipped set is `bugfix`, `classic`, `enterprise`, `express`, `feature`, `infra`, `mvp`, `poc`, `refactor`, `security-patch`, `workshop`.
2. **Membership** lives in each stage's `scopes:` frontmatter — the list of scopes for which that stage is EXECUTE.

`aidlc engine graph compile` (the same compile path that produces `stage-graph.json`) transposes these into the grid at `tools/data/scope-grid.json` — a `scope → {stages: {slug: EXECUTE|SKIP}}` map that the engine reads for all scope-level routing. The engine's `validScopes()` derives its canonical scope-name set from that compiled grid.

Adding a scope is purely additive: drop `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md`, tag the member stages' `scopes:` lists, recompile, and regenerate the human-readable summary table in `SKILL.md`. No dispatch-logic edit is required, and the drift guards prevent the on-disk set from diverging.

---

## 6. The swarm referee, the driver seam, and the Bolt-DAG

The **swarm** is how parallel Construction work converges under human-granted autonomy. It fires only inside a live `/aidlc` session, so the conductor (that session) owns the fan-out and the retry loop; `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` is the deterministic **referee** the conductor consults while it owns the loop itself. This is the three-concerns split applied to convergence: the conductor owns fan-out and the retry decision (knowledge), the tool owns the convergence verdict + merge + audit (determinism), and the human grants autonomy and takes the baton back on the failure envelope (judgement).

The referee is **stateless** — no iteration counter, no persisted progress — with three subcommands:

| Subcommand | Role | Emits |
|------------|------|-------|
| `prepare --batch <n> --units <a,b,c> [--base <branch>] [--degraded-from <subagent\|ultracode>]` | On autonomous Code Generation, first require each Unit's current fingerprinted plan, test instructions, Testing Contract, and explicit Plan Approval. Then fork an isolated git worktree per Unit (composing `aidlc-worktree create` + `aidlc-bolt start --worktree`). | `SWARM_STARTED` (plus `SWARM_DEGRADED` when a loud downgrade is reported). |
| `check <unit> --check-cmd <cmd> [--test-file <path>]` | Stateless single-unit verdict: run the project's own check command (exit 0 = green, the authoritative signal — a worker's self-claim is never trusted) plus an anti-tamper compare of the protected file against its forked-git baseline. Prints `{converged, tampered, reason}`; exits 0 iff genuinely converged. | None (advisory; informs the conductor's retry decision). |
| `finalize --batch <n> --units <a,b,c> --claimed <a,b> --check-cmd <cmd> [--test-file <path>] [--reasons <unit>=<reason>,…]` | The authoritative gate: **re-run the check on every claimed unit** and, when the current stage declares a reviewer, require that unit's matching terminal receipt after its Bolt started. For a modern source-bearing worktree it also requires the current global `Source Fingerprint`, current `Unit Source Fingerprint` and manifest-byte binding, the attested raw-aware `Base Source Listing`, and containment of every base-to-worktree source change by the reviewed manifest claims. `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` explicitly bypasses those source checks only; the convergence row records the bypass and source merge must repeat the switch. A claimed unit that is red, tampered, unreviewed, stale, or outside its reviewed footprint is refused before merge (the lying-conductor guard), then genuine passes snapshot and land exact declared record artifacts plus the bound source manifest before merging AIDLC metadata under the serial HOLD-MERGE lock. The conductor must next run the correlated `aidlc-worktree merge`; it consumes the immutable `Source Commit`, emits `SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED`, and is cleanup-idempotent after that authority lands. Modern batch routing and settled approval require the complete aggregate chain. Exits 0 (record/metadata convergence) or 2 (failure envelope). | `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` / `SWARM_UNIT_FAILED` / `SWARM_BATON_RETURNED` / `SWARM_COMPLETED`; later source merge emits `SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED`. |

These seven `SWARM_*` events are part of the 95-event audit taxonomy (see [State Machine](12-state-machine.md)). On an exit-2 envelope the conductor takes the baton back - failure always halts and re-engages the human regardless of autonomy mode.

**The driver seam.** `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` selects an inline Dynamic Workflow driver (the conductor authors a `Workflow` whose JS owns the per-unit pipeline and the iteration cap); unset selects the subagent floor (N parallel `Task` calls in one message, one per unit). If `=1` but the Workflow tool is unavailable, the conductor **loud-degrades** to the floor and passes `--degraded-from ultracode` so the referee emits `SWARM_DEGRADED`. The runaway backstop is not a cap inside the tool - it is the harness's Stop-hook ceiling, which is 8 blocks on this autonomous-Construction path (§3).

Every Code Generation worker receives the same approved contract as the normal
path: `AIDLC-UNIT`, `AIDLC-TESTING-CONTRACT`, the full plan, and the full unit
test instructions. Workers never re-resolve Testing Posture independently.

**The Bolt-DAG.** The batch the swarm fans out comes from the `bolt_dag` node of `runtime-graph.json` (see [Runtime Graph](13-runtime-graph.md)), parsed from units-generation's `unit-of-work-dependency.md` edge block. The node carries `units` (each with its `depends_on` list) and `batches` — topological levels where every unit's dependencies are satisfied by prior batches, so a batch's units can fan out in parallel. The node is present only once a valid edge block exists on disk; an absent, malformed, or cyclic block omits the node entirely (the gate-time required-sections sensor flags those upstream).
