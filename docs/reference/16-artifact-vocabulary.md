# Artifact Vocabulary

This chapter is the written rule for AI-DLC artifact names — the canonical
strings that appear in each stage's `produces:` and `consumes[].artifact:`
YAML frontmatter. It covers the naming shape, the collision-resolution policy,
the filesystem-path convention, and how to view the live registry from the
command line.

The registry itself is **derived**, not written. The authoritative source
for "which canonical names exist" is the `produces[]` field on every stage
file, unioned with each stage's `optional_produces[]` (artifacts a stage may
conditionally write per unit, see the field reference in
`15-stage-definition.md`), so a conditionally-produced name stays registered
and resolvable to its producer. A helper in
`core/tools/aidlc-graph.ts` reads the compiled stage graph and
returns the union as a set — the same pattern used for scopes
(`validScopes()` at `aidlc-lib.ts:772`) and for agents (`loadAgents()` at
`aidlc-lib.ts:794`). Keeping the registry out of this chapter prevents the
drift that parallel hand-maintained lists invite.

## What an artifact is here

An artifact is a **canonical identifier** declared by a producing stage in its
YAML frontmatter. Other stages reference the same identifier in `consumes[]` to
declare a read dependency. Every consumed identifier has exactly one producer;
unconsumed names may be shared by stages that write independent files under
their own record directories. The identifier is a short kebab-case string — no
file extension, no folder prefix, no slash.

Concrete example from milestone 4's worked example in
`core/aidlc-common/protocols/stage-definition.md`:

```yaml
slug: scope-definition
# ...
produces:
  - scope-document
  - intent-backlog
  - scope-definition-questions
consumes:
  - artifact: intent-statement
    required: true
  - artifact: feasibility-assessment
    required: false
```

Here `scope-document`, `intent-backlog`, `scope-definition-questions` are
artifacts the scope-definition stage produces; `intent-statement` and
`feasibility-assessment` are artifacts it consumes (produced by other
stages — `intent-capture` and `feasibility` respectively).

Things that are **not** artifacts in this registry:

- **File paths.** `<record>/ideation/scope-definition/scope-document.md`
  (where `<record>/` is the intent's record dir, `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`)
  is a filesystem location; the canonical name is `scope-document`. See
  "Filesystem mapping" below.
- **Filenames.** The on-disk `.md` file and the canonical name don't have
  to match (they usually do, except at collisions).
- **State plumbing.** `aidlc-state.md`, `audit.md`, and
  `.aidlc-recovery.md` are managed by tools (`aidlc-state.ts`, hook
  scripts), not by stages via `produces[]`. They never appear in the
  registry.
- **Runtime values.** Strings like "user's prose answer" or
  "workspace classification (greenfield/brownfield)" are dynamic data,
  not durable stage-to-stage artifacts.

---

## The derivation rule

1. **Stage files are authoritative.** Each stage's `produces:` list
   declares every canonical name the stage emits. `consumes:` names the
   canonical strings the stage depends on.
2. **The registry is computed, not written.** Run
   `aidlc engine graph artifacts` to
   print the live registry — one name per line, sorted alphabetically.
   The tool unions every stage's `produces[]` and `optional_produces[]` from the
   compiled `stage-graph.json`.
3. **No parallel list in this chapter.** If a reader wants the enumeration,
   they run the tool. This chapter never lists canonical names as a
   registry table.
4. **Membership is validated by the doctor.** `/aidlc --doctor` runs a
   "Graph references" check (`aidlc-utility.ts`) — every `consumes[].artifact`
   entry and `requires_stage[]` slug must resolve against the derived registry.
   Orphan consumers are reported as broken references.

All 33 stage files declare `produces:`, so the derivation returns the full
registry. The tool is well-defined on empty data too — a stage with no
`produces:` simply contributes nothing — but in the shipped framework every
stage is populated.

---

## Naming rules

Every canonical name must satisfy `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/` — the shape
enforced by `SLUG_RE` in
`core/tools/aidlc-stage-schema.ts`. That means:

- **Lowercase only.** `scope-document`, not `ScopeDocument` or
  `SCOPE_DOCUMENT`.
- **No file extension.** `scope-document`, not `scope-document.md`.
- **No folder prefix, no slash.** `scope-document`, not
  `ideation/scope-definition/scope-document`.
- **Start with a letter.** `s1` is legal; `1-thing` is not.
- **Inner hyphens, digits, lowercase letters only.** No underscores, no
  spaces, no Unicode letters.

Question artifacts follow a `<stage-slug>-questions` convention by
tradition — stages that collect user input declare a sibling
`<slug>-questions` canonical name alongside their main deliverables.
Tradition, not a parser rule.

The shape is **flat namespace** — no hierarchical prefix like
`<phase>/<stage>/<artifact>`. This matches every other AI-DLC identifier:
agent slugs, scope names, stage slugs, phase names are all flat kebab.

---

## Collision policy

Two stages **must not** declare the same canonical name across `produces[]` and
`optional_produces[]` when any stage consumes that name. `aidlc-graph compile`
rejects the ambiguity because runtime consume resolution needs one owning
producer; the error names all producing files and one consuming stage. When the
same consumed concept is emitted by two stages, pick distinct names that
disambiguate.

Shared names are valid when no stage consumes them. The shipped `traceability`
artifact follows this pattern: eight stages each write their own
`traceability.json` under their own record directory, and no downstream stage
resolves `traceability` through `producersOf()`.

Today's one example: both `build-and-test` (Construction) and
`performance-validation` (Operation) write a file called `test-results.md`.
The canonical names are split so the two never collide on the wire:

- `build-test-results` — emitted by `build-and-test`. Pairs with
  sibling names in that stage: `build-instructions`,
  `integration-test-instructions`, `performance-test-instructions`,
  `security-test-instructions`, `build-and-test-summary`.
- `unit-test-instructions` is produced per-unit by `code-generation` and
  consumed by `build-and-test`.
- `source-manifest.json` is the engine-required per-unit companion to
  `code-generation`'s declared artifacts. It deliberately is **not** in
  `produces[]`: changing that set would retroactively invalidate in-flight
  artifact fingerprints. The strict JSON manifest attributes created, modified,
  and deleted application-source paths; terminal review stamping requires it,
  and its bytes/content claims are bound by `Unit Source Fingerprint`.
- `load-test-results` — emitted by `performance-validation`. Pairs with
  `load-test-plan` already produced by the same stage.

Both names ship in the respective stages' `produces:` lists today.

**On-disk filenames don't have to match.** Both stages can keep writing to
`test-results.md` in their respective folders; the canonical name is the
wire identifier, not the filename.

## Filesystem mapping

Artifacts live on disk at paths that are derivable from `(canonical
name) + (producing stage) + (per-unit flag)`. Markdown is the default extension;
the canonical `traceability` artifact is the structured-data exception and
resolves to `traceability.json`. Two placement shapes apply:

- **Non-per-unit stages (25 of 30):**
  `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/<artifact-filename>`
  Example: `feasibility-assessment` (produced by the Ideation
  `feasibility` stage) lives at
  `<record>/ideation/feasibility/feasibility-assessment.md`.

- **Per-unit Construction stages (5 of 30):** `nfr-requirements`,
  `nfr-design`, `functional-design`, `infrastructure-design`, and
  `code-generation`. These emit one copy of each artifact per Unit of
  Work during Construction:
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/<stage>/<artifact-filename>`
  Example: `functional-spec` (produced by `functional-design`) lives
  at
  `<record>/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/functional-spec.md`.

Per-unit status is declared by the stage's `for_each: unit-of-work`
frontmatter field — the five Construction stages that run once per Unit carry
it; the rest omit it. A future helper could compute the path mechanically from
stage graph + canonical name.

`artifactFilename()` in `aidlc-lib.ts` is the shared extension resolver used by
directives, per-Unit coverage, completion guards, and review fingerprints.
Every artifact except `traceability` resolves to `<canonical-name>.md`;
`traceability` resolves to `traceability.json`.

**Review records are not artifacts.** A reviewer-bearing stage's review result
(verdict, findings, reviewer, request id, the fingerprints it binds, and the
review text) lives in a framework-owned record at
`<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/stage/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` for stage scope,
or `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/units/<unit>/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` for a Unit,
written only by `aidlc-log.ts review --verdict` and named, with its digest, by
the `REVIEW_COMPLETED` row. The stage's `review_artifact` names which declared
artifact the review is about (the gate's `**Review:**` path and the
`--reject-finding <artifact>#R-NN` selector key); the reviewer never writes to
it. A terminal `## Review` section inside an artifact is a review recorded
before review records existed: readable for migration, never written anew.

**Summary authorizations are not artifacts either.** The active summary
confirmation for a stage (and Unit) lives at
`<record>/.aidlc-summary-authorization/<stage>/stage.json` for stage scope, or
`<record>/.aidlc-summary-authorization/<stage>/units/<unit>.json` for a Unit,
written by `aidlc-log.ts answer --checkpoint summary-confirmation` on `Looks
correct` and removed on `Request changes`. It holds the `Summary Authorization
Id` the receipt row carries; the write-audit hook reads it to stamp the stage's
`ARTIFACT_CREATED`/`ARTIFACT_UPDATED` rows, and completion compares those stamps
to the current receipt. It is not an output, is never reviewed, and is not
listed in `produces[]`.

**Codekb is the space-level exception.** Reverse-engineering's 9 artifacts
(`business-overview`, `architecture`, `code-structure`, `api-documentation`,
`component-inventory`, `technology-stack`, `dependencies`,
`code-quality-assessment`, `reverse-engineering-timestamp`) do **not** resolve
under the per-intent record dir. They land in the durable, per-repo code
knowledge base at `aidlc/spaces/<space>/codekb/<repo>/` — a store shared across
every intent in the space, keyed by repo rather than by intent. The path is
resolved outside the record-relative rule via the `isCodekb` branch in
`resolveArtifactPath` (`core/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts`), and
the same directory is printed by the read-only native route
`aidlc engine workspace codekb`.

**Canonical name ≠ filename for collisions.** Where a collision is split
(see above), the on-disk filename may keep the pre-split form
(`test-results.md`) while the canonical name is the disambiguated
version. Use the stage's `produces:` list and
`aidlc engine graph artifacts` as the source of truth, not the
filesystem.

## How to view the live registry

```bash
aidlc engine graph artifacts
```

Prints one canonical name per line, alphabetically sorted.

Pre-PR-8 output is empty — stages haven't migrated to YAML yet and
`produces:` isn't populated. Post-PR-8 the output grows to roughly 119
names across 30 non-initialisation stages.

Pipe through `wc -l` for a count, `grep` for a filter, or `diff` against
an expected baseline for a drift check.

## Adding or renaming an artifact

No edit to this chapter required — the registry is derived.

**To add a new artifact:**

1. Edit the producing stage's `.md` file and add the canonical name to
   its `produces:` list.
2. Run `aidlc engine graph artifacts` to confirm it appears.
3. Run `/aidlc --doctor` to confirm no consumer references a name that no
   longer exists (the "Graph references" check).

**To rename an artifact:**

1. Rename it in the producing stage's `produces:` entry.
2. Rename it in every consuming stage's `consumes[].artifact` entry.
3. `/aidlc --doctor` (post-PR-11) catches any consumer you forgot to
   update — the old name becomes a missing-producer error.

Stage-graph CI drift detection (`aidlc-graph compile --check`) catches
renames that forget to regenerate `stage-graph.json` from the YAML
sources.

## Stability

The live registry at v1.0 ship time is the stability baseline for the
framework's artifact surface. The stability policy for artifact names is:

- **Renames** and **removals** are major-version changes — v1.x → v2.0.
- **Additions** ship in minor versions — v1.0 → v1.1, etc.
- **In-flight until v1.0**: the current v0.3.0 Foundation set is the
  starting point; later v0.4.0–v0.11.0 releases may add, rename, or drop
  names as the methodology evolves.

The policy is enforceable against live data: a drift between the registry
at tag time and the registry at HEAD is a one-line `diff`.
