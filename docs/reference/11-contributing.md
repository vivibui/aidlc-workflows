# Contributing

## Overview

Contributions to this implementation are welcome. This guide covers prerequisites, development workflow, testing, and how to submit changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** -- native install (recommended, auto-updates): macOS/Linux/WSL `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`; Windows PowerShell `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`. Or `brew install --cask claude-code`. (see [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart))
- **bun** -- Required to build, package, test, directly run authored TypeScript sources, and use locally generated `dist/<harness>/` projections. Native release runtimes use the installed `aidlc` command. Install via `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`; on Windows use `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"`.
- **timeout** (GNU coreutils) -- Required by the test suite for LLM test timeouts (L2/L3). Pre-installed on Linux. macOS: `brew install coreutils` then add gnubin to PATH: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"` (in `~/.zshenv` or `~/.zshrc`).
- **Bash** -- Optional for the POSIX compatibility wrapper (`tests/run-tests.sh`). The primary test runner is `bun tests/run-tests.ts`; at runtime, none of the distributable hooks require Bash.
- **Bedrock access** -- Required for running live integration and e2e tests (L2/L3). Not needed for L1 protocol tests.

After cloning, install the pinned development dependencies used by the
packager, type checker, and tests:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and branch** from `main` (the integration branch and PR target), then run `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
2. **Read the architecture** -- [reference/01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) explains the execution model, agent delegation, and hook system
3. **Understand the entry points** -- the deterministic engine `core/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts` (with exactly five subcommands: `next`, `continue`, `report`, `park`, and `team-board`; `continue` is internal steering transport and `team-board` is the read-only Team Construction query) owns routing; the conductor `harness/claude/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md` is a thin forwarding loop that acts on its directives. For the normative engine / directive / conductor / swarm contract see [The Skill System](17-skill-system.md)
4. **Make changes** -- Edit the harness-neutral source in `core/` (tools, stages, agents, hooks, rules, knowledge) or a harness surface in `harness/<name>/` (the orchestrator skill, settings). Then run `bun scripts/package.ts` to materialize the ignored local `dist/` and `dist-release/` roots. Never hand-edit or commit either root. `package.ts --check` ignores those on-disk trees, builds the complete projection set twice in independent temporary roots, and byte-compares the results.
5. **Test** -- Run `bun tests/run-tests.ts` before submitting
6. **Submit** -- Open a PR against `main`

Release binary artifacts are not part of `dist/` and are not produced by the
packager. After `bun scripts/package.ts --check` is clean, run
`bun scripts/build-binaries.ts` for the native artifact or add `--all-targets`
for the release matrix. The script writes each executable under
`build/binaries/<target>/`, stages complete generated distributions under that
target's `runtime/<harness>/` directory, and writes
`build/binaries/build-results-<target>.json`. Targets executable on the build
host run sensors, graph compilation, validation, generated-surface checks,
plugin selection/composition, orchestration, ordinary Bolt and autonomous
swarm composition,
packaged-runtime immutability, hooks, statusline, adapters, explicit project
routing, doctor JSON, init dry-run, versions/plugin listings, Unix completions,
and package verification without a `bun` executable on `PATH`. Cross artifacts
receive inspection gates and are explicitly labeled `UNVERIFIED`; host-run
artifacts are labeled `VERIFIED`.
The staged `runtime/<harness>/` trees are read-only fallbacks; mutating commands
must target an installed project harness. Any failed gate fails the build.

After the target binaries are present, `bun scripts/package-release.ts`
regenerates and verifies the local projections, packages `dist-release/` into
the versioned `aidlc-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, and emits `version.json`, `checksums.txt`,
`install.sh`, and `install.ps1`. The per-target `runtime/` directories are
smoke-gate staging; release data archives are rebuilt from the freshly
generated native projections, not copied from those sidecars.
`--require-release-matrix` requires all seven targets and a matching
verification record for each binary. The generated flat directory is the
contract consumed by the installer and `release packaging tooling`.

The tag-triggered release workflow is deliberately candidate-preserving:
verification and installer lint run first; target-native jobs produce binaries
and evidence; `package-release.ts` runs once to create `release-candidate`; the
staging job checksums and uploads it without signing; and Unix/Windows lifecycle
jobs consume those bytes. `publish` re-verifies and attests the candidate, adds
the exported bundle, validates the complete inventory, and uploads one
`attested-release` artifact. `release` rechecks the tag and checksums, creates
the GitHub Release in this repository with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and verifies the
uploaded asset inventory. Never rebuild, repackage, or substitute the
candidate. The full trust design is
[Supply-Chain Security](19-supply-chain-security.md).

## Testing

The suite is entirely TypeScript (`t*.test.ts`, run via `bun`) across four levels — `smoke`, `unit`, `integration`, `e2e` — that map onto the three-layer pyramid (smoke + unit = L1 Protocol, integration = L2 Stage, e2e = L3 Acceptance). After the pinned development dependencies are installed, L1 runs locally without external services; the live integration and e2e files require the `claude` CLI tool (and Bedrock creds) and skip cleanly when it is absent.

**Quick reference:**

```bash
# L1 Protocol -- runs in seconds, no dependencies
bun tests/run-tests.ts

# L2 Stage -- CI pipeline (requires claude CLI tool)
bun tests/run-tests.ts --ci

# L3 Acceptance -- release gate (requires claude CLI tool)
bun tests/run-tests.ts --release

# POSIX compatibility wrapper
bash tests/run-tests.sh --ci

# Individual levels
bash tests/run-tests.sh --smoke        # File structure validation
bash tests/run-tests.sh --unit         # Hook behavior, stage content
bash tests/run-tests.sh --integration  # Cross-component and stage/CLI tests
bash tests/run-tests.sh --e2e          # Workflow, worktree, and terminal journeys
```

## Changing Dispatcher Routes

`core/tools/aidlc.ts` is the registry for public, hidden, and host-only command
routes. A new route must declare all policy dimensions rather than inheriting
behavior accidentally:

1. Set `projectRequirement`, `outputModes`, `visibility`, `networkPolicy`, and
   `mutationScope`.
2. Choose `pinPolicy` deliberately: `active` for machine lifecycle/management,
   `inspect` for active-binary diagnosis and repair, or `pinned` for project
   engine behavior.
3. Map the route to an existing tool or add the tool to `TOOLS`; hooks,
   statusline, adapters, and low-level delegates use route-only entries rather
   than public aliases.
4. Add route and policy assertions to
   `tests/unit/t230-dispatcher-routes.test.ts`, including global-flag ordering
   and compiled/dev parity when applicable.
5. If authored prose invokes the command, use `{{INVOKE}}` or
   `{{TOOL_PREFIX}}` so copy and native projections stay distinct. Regenerate
   both local channels and run the package determinism guard.

## Adding an Install-Mechanism Mutation

Project and machine mutations in init, lifecycle, pinning, and plugin management
must use `core/tools/aidlc-transaction.ts`. Build a `TransactionPlan` from
root-relative, non-overlapping operations; include `expected` destination state
and source hashes for copy/tree operations. Put semantic checks in
`validateCandidates` or `validateCommitted`, not after a successful transaction
returns. A committed validator failure is part of the transaction and therefore
rolls back.

Add fault-injection coverage before shipping: fail before/after staging,
snapshot, commit, and committed validation as appropriate; assert every prior
byte and mode is restored, the lock is released, and incomplete rollback leaves
named recovery evidence. `t243-install-mechanism.test.ts` is the engine pattern;
`t224-plugin-selection.test.ts` and `t242-plugin-state.test.ts` are project
mutation examples.

## Adding a Utility Handler

> **Before adding an audit event**, read [State Machine](12-state-machine.md). The chapter lists every event in the taxonomy, its emitter, and the "same-commit rule" — update the code AND the chapter's tables in the same PR, or the drift test will fail.

Utility handlers fall into two categories:

### Deterministic handlers (preferred)
For handlers that require no LLM reasoning (print text, read/format files, check prerequisites, create directories):
1. Add a subcommand to `core/tools/aidlc-utility.ts`
2. Register a semantic dispatcher noun/verb and call it from SKILL.md through `aidlc engine <noun> <verb>` (or its public route)
3. No task tracking needed -- the script runs in under a second
4. Handle audit logging inside the script via `appendAuditEntry` from `aidlc-audit.ts` (never hand-write `**Event**:` markdown blocks)
5. Add the verb to the `aidlc-utility` usage string. If it renders a generated SKILL.md region, also document the corresponding `--check` guard in this chapter.

The `--help`, `--version`, `--status`, and `--doctor` handlers are reference implementations. `--doctor` also accepts `--export` (with an optional `--output <dir>`), which runs a fresh doctor pass and then writes a small, redacted diagnostic report; the shared `DoctorFinding` model and the report-assembly logic live in `core/tools/aidlc-doctor-bundle.ts`, so the live report and the exported report draw from one set of findings.

The `codekb-path`, `codekb-snapshot`, `codekb-publish`, and
`codekb-scope-diff` handlers are **direct utility verbs**: stage prose invokes
`bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc-utility.ts <verb>`, not `/aidlc <verb>`
(`codekb-path` is also reachable through the dispatcher as
`aidlc engine workspace codekb`).
`codekb-path` and `codekb-scope-diff` are read-only. `codekb-snapshot` may
recover an interrupted prior CodeKB directory swap before returning the
source/store generations. `codekb-publish` is the sole shared-store writer: it
validates a complete nine-file candidate and commits it under a space+repo
compare-and-swap lock. None emits an audit event or drives SKILL.md task
tracking.

`project-description` and `document-input` use the same read-only direct-utility
shape. Both consuming stages invoke `project-description` first: a marked
record must decode its exact `project-description.json` string, while an
unmarked pre-2.6.115 record explicitly falls back to the legacy `Project` state
field. They invoke
`bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc-utility.ts document-input` after writing the
selected path with the native file-write tool to the active record's fixed
`.aidlc-document-input-path` transport. Customer-chosen path bytes never enter
the shell command. The handler resolves one exact project-root path, records
the contained file identity, and requires the opened descriptor to match it
before reading; parent-directory replacement, redirects, and unsupported input
are refused. Successful reads emit the same inline untrusted-path and
untrusted-content notices as DocumentKB.

### LLM-driven handlers
For handlers that benefit from agent reasoning (filesystem scanning, decision-making):
1. **Task tracking** -- Create tasks via `TaskCreate` for each logical step, transition them with `TaskUpdate` (`in_progress` -> `completed`) as work progresses. This drives the task sidebar in Claude Code.
2. **Statusline update** -- If the active intent's `aidlc-state.md` exists, temporarily set `Current Stage` to describe the running utility (e.g., `running health check`), then restore the original value when done. The `aidlc-statusline.ts` hook reads this field for the terminal status bar.
3. **Audit logging** -- Invoke the appropriate semantic native dispatcher route, whose backing handler calls `appendAuditEntry` internally. Never hand-write `**Event**:` markdown blocks from LLM prose — see [State Machine: Forbidden patterns](12-state-machine.md).

The `intent-create` handler is fully deterministic: all three init stages (workspace-scaffold, workspace-detection, state-init) run inside a single `aidlc-utility intent-create` call. The welcome message is rendered at session start via `companyAnnouncements` in `settings.json` and is not a stage.

## Adding a Scope

A scope is authored as a file (its identity) plus a per-stage membership tag. The identity lives in `core/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md`; the membership lives in each stage's frontmatter `scopes:` list under `core/aidlc-common/stages/`. Validation logic across `init`, `scope-change`, `resolve-env-scope`, `doctor`, and state tooling derives the list of valid scopes from the `.claude/scopes/*.md` files at runtime via `validScopes()` in `core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts`; the EXECUTE/SKIP grid is the transpose of the per-stage `scopes:` lists, compiled to `tools/data/scope-grid.json`. Adding a scope requires no TypeScript edits.

### Steps

1. **Create `core/scopes/aidlc-hotfix.md`** — the scope's identity. Frontmatter:
   - `name` (required): the scope name; must equal the filename stem.
   - `depth` (required): `Minimal` | `Standard` | `Comprehensive`.
   - `keywords` (optional): NL triggers for `/aidlc <freeform text>` auto-detection. Flat string lists may use block (`- item`) or flow (`[item, item]`) form. Word-boundary matched, alphabetical-scope tie-break. Empty list opts out of inference.
   - `description` (optional): one-line summary rendered in `/aidlc --help` and in SKILL.md's compiled scope-table.
   - `testStrategy` (optional): override test strategy independent of depth. Defaults to matching depth.
   - `review_cap` (optional): `adversarial` | `advisory` | `none`. Caps stage review classes for this scope; absence means no scope-level lowering. The cap can lower but never raise a stage declaration. Autonomous swarm reviews are exempt.
   - `runner` (optional): set `true` to include the scope in the default generated runner set.
   - `freeform_default` (optional): set `true` to nominate this scope when the preferred core default (`classic`) is not enabled. At most one enabled scope may claim it; graph compilation rejects ambiguous selected plugin sets. Unknown explicit `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` values still fail validation.
   - `change_control` (optional): `strict` | `relaxed`. The Change Control default every new intent on the scope starts with: what happens when an input changes after a human approved or confirmed something (strict reopens the approval; relaxed records the change once and continues). Absence means strict. Validated like `skeleton` (the loader names the file and the two values). A memory layer's `## Change Control` `Mode: strict` wins over any scope default.

   The body is prose intent — "why these stages, why skip those". `validScopes()` derives from `.claude/scopes/*.md` presence, so the scope is valid the moment the file lands. Run `/aidlc --doctor` after editing to catch structural issues.

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: hotfix
   depth: Minimal
   keywords:
     - hotfix
     - urgent
   description: Urgent production fix
   runner: true
   ---

   # hotfix scope

   Lean path for the urgent production patch — regression test and deploy, nothing else.
   ```

2. **Tag the member stages** — in each stage that should run under `hotfix` (under `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/`), add `hotfix` to its frontmatter `scopes:` list. A stage you don't tag is `SKIP` for the scope. The 3 initialization stages (`workspace-scaffold`, `workspace-detection`, `state-init`) must include it — they always run.

3. **Recompile + regenerate the scope-table** — `aidlc engine graph compile` transposes the `scopes:` tags into `tools/data/scope-grid.json`. Then `aidlc engine gen scope-table` prints the canonical Markdown region for SKILL.md's compiled scope table. Keep the region between the `<!-- BEGIN: compiled ... -->` / `<!-- END: compiled ... -->` markers generated, then run `aidlc engine graph compile --check` and `aidlc engine gen scope-table --check` to confirm exit 0 (no drift).

4. **Verify the scope resolves** - `bun core/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create --scope hotfix --project-dir /tmp/scope-smoke` should succeed and produce a state file with `Scope: hotfix`.

5. **Verify `doctor` accepts it as an env default** — `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE=hotfix aidlc doctor` should report the env var as valid.

6. **Verify keyword inference** (if `keywords` populated) — `aidlc engine scope detect --from-text --input "urgent customer issue" --project-dir /tmp/scope-smoke` should return `{"scope":"hotfix","source":"keyword","matches":["urgent"]}`.

7. **Verify plan parity (optional but recommended)** — `AIDLC_GRAPH_RESOLVE=1 aidlc engine graph resolve hotfix --stdout` emits the scope's plan; eyeball that the EXECUTE set matches what you tagged.

8. **Update scope-aware documentation** — `docs/guide/05-scopes-and-depth.md` (full scope reference, including the Stage-by-Scope Matrix — its cells are drift-guarded against the compiled `scope-grid.json` by `tests/unit/t244-scope-matrix-doc-sync.test.ts`), `docs/guide/13-customization.md` (valid values list and scope table), and `docs/reference/03-orchestrator.md` (scope-to-stage mapping) all enumerate scopes explicitly. Per the documentation policy at the end of this chapter, update them in the same PR.

9. **Add a scope-routing workflow test** — if the scope has behavior that differs from existing scopes (new phase skipping pattern, new depth combination), add a routed journey test modeled after `tests/e2e/t53.test.ts` (sdk scope routing) or `tests/e2e/t-tui-t50-bugfix-scope.serial.test.ts` (tui scope run-through).

### What validates automatically

- `validScopes().has("hotfix")` returns `true` the moment the `.claude/scopes/aidlc-hotfix.md` file lands — every validation site uses this helper.
- Error messages list the new scope in alphabetical order without any code changes.
- `/aidlc --doctor` treats `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE=hotfix` as valid.
- `aidlc-utility scope-change --scope hotfix` on an in-flight workflow accepts the new scope.
- The transpose drift guard: `aidlc-graph compile --check` fails the build if a stage's `scopes:` tag was edited without recompiling `scope-grid.json`. SKILL.md's compiled scope-table has its own `--check` drift guard (t67).
- Keyword detection for freeform `/aidlc <text>` invocations reads each scope's `keywords` from its `.claude/scopes/*.md` frontmatter. Custom scopes with their own NL triggers auto-detect as soon as the `keywords` list is populated (no SKILL.md change needed). Users can still pass `--scope hotfix` explicitly to bypass inference.

### What does NOT validate automatically

- A `scopes:` tag with a typo'd scope name still compiles — it just produces a grid column nobody asks for, silently dropping that stage from the real scope. `/aidlc --doctor` and a per-scope test are the guardrails.
- Stage skipping semantics (`PHASE_SKIPPED` events). `tests/integration/t39.test.ts` hardcodes the 9 known scope names in a per-scope loop — a new scope is not exercised until that list is extended. Add your new scope to that loop as part of the same PR.

## Adding a Stage

A stage is authored as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter under `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md`. The compiler reads the frontmatter into `tools/data/stage-graph.json`, and the runner generator emits a typeable `/aidlc-<slug>` skill from the compiled stage list for core stages (plugin-owned stages use their bare plugin-prefixed slug). The extensibility contract is "to add a stage, write a stage file" — no engine edit is required to register it, because the engine routes off the compiled graph. (The full field reference and the three-compartment body format live in the Harness Engineer Guide's [Anatomy of a Stage](../harness-engineering/01-anatomy-of-a-stage.md) and [Adding a Stage](../harness-engineering/02-adding-a-stage.md); the schema is [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md).)

### Steps

1. **Write the stage file** - create `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md`. Frontmatter declares `slug`, `phase`, `execution`/`condition`, `lead_agent` and any `support_agents` (by agent slug), `mode` (`inline`, `subagent`, `pipeline`, or `mob`; `agent-team` is reserved and not yet implemented), `consumes` / `produces` (artifact vocabulary names), `optional_produces` for artifacts the stage writes only conditionally per unit (exempt from per-unit coverage), `requires_stage` (ordering edges), the `scopes:` membership list, any `sensors:` to bind, `for_each` if it iterates per Unit, and (on a per-unit stage) an optional `produces_kinds` map to prune produces artifacts to each Unit's kind. The body carries the stage's three compartments. See [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md) for the full field contract.

2. **Recompile the graph** — `aidlc engine graph compile` reads the new frontmatter into `tools/data/stage-graph.json` and transposes the `scopes:` tags into `tools/data/scope-grid.json`. Run `aidlc engine graph compile --check` to confirm exit 0 (no drift). Then refresh the generated SKILL.md mirrors with `aidlc engine gen stage-table` and `aidlc engine gen scope-table`, and confirm `aidlc engine gen stage-table --check` plus `scope-table --check` both exit 0. The stage is runnable immediately via `aidlc engine orchestrate next --stage <slug> --single`.

3. **Regenerate the runners** — `aidlc engine gen runners` emits a `/aidlc-<slug>` runner skill per runnable compiled stage, so your new stage gets its typeable command with no hand-authoring. Run `aidlc engine gen runners --check` to confirm the on-disk runner set matches the compiled stage set (the drift guard; the bootstrap initialization stages are excluded by design).

4. **Verify the stage routes** — drive `aidlc engine orchestrate next` over a workflow whose scope includes the stage, and confirm the engine emits a `run-stage` directive naming your slug with the resolved `lead_agent`, gate, `consumes`, and `produces`.

5. **Update scope-aware and stage-aware documentation** — a new stage changes the stage count and the per-scope plans. Update `docs/guide/05-scopes-and-depth.md` (the Stage-by-Scope Matrix — its cells are drift-guarded by `tests/unit/t244-scope-matrix-doc-sync.test.ts`), `docs/reference/16-artifact-vocabulary.md` (the non-initialisation stage count), the Harness Engineer Guide's stage chapters, and any scope reference that enumerates the plan. Per the documentation policy at the end of this chapter, do it in the same PR.

6. **Add a test and refresh coverage** — author a `t*.test.ts` for the stage's behaviour (the suite is discovered, so dropping the file under the right level directory is all the runner needs — there is no registry row to add). Then regenerate the coverage index with `bun tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts` and confirm `bun tests/gen-coverage-registry.ts --check` is clean. The stage-runner drift guard `tests/unit/t129-stage-runner-drift.test.ts` asserts the generated runner set equals the compiled stage set, and `tests/integration/t55-test-suite-drift.test.ts` sweeps for stale paths and markers.

### What validates automatically

- **Graph placement.** Once you `compile`, the stage's edges (`requires_stage`, `consumes`, `produces`) are resolved and ordered; `compile --check` fails the build if the on-disk `stage-graph.json` drifts from the frontmatter.
- **Generated stage table.** SKILL.md's Stage Graph table is rendered from compiled `stage-graph.json`; `aidlc-utility stage-table --check` fails if the generated region drifts (t32).
- **Schema + references.** `aidlc-graph.ts compile` validates every stage's frontmatter via `aidlc-stage-schema.ts`, and `/aidlc --doctor` re-runs `validateStageFrontmatter` plus a "Graph references" check that every `lead_agent` / `support_agents` / `consumes` slug resolves.
- **Runner parity.** `aidlc-runner-gen.ts check` (and `t129`) fail if a compiled stage has no runner, or a runner exists for a stage that is gone.

### What does NOT validate automatically

- **A new frontmatter key the compiler doesn't recognise.** Wanting a key the schema doesn't implement is a framework change: it edits the code that reads the data, so it follows the engine/compile-pipeline path rather than this recipe. The reserved-key namespace in [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md) exists so future structural extensions land predictably.
- **Documentation enumerations.** Stage counts and per-scope plan tables across `docs/` are maintained by hand; update them in the same PR (see Documentation Policy below).

## Adding an Agent

Agent metadata (display name, example knowledge files) is read from each agent's `.md` frontmatter under `core/agents/`. The `loadAgents()` helper in `core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts` discovers every `.md` file in that directory and derives the metadata map consumed by the statusline hook (to render the display name). Adding an agent requires no TypeScript edits.

### Steps

1. **Create the agent file** — drop a new `core/agents/<slug>-agent.md` with the required frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <slug>-agent
   display_name: <Human-Readable Name>
   examples:
     - example-knowledge-file-one.md
     - example-knowledge-file-two.md
   description: >
     One-paragraph description of the agent's responsibilities and which stages it leads or supports.
   disallowedTools: Task
   tier: judgment
   ---
   ```

   The `name` field must match the filename stem exactly. `display_name` is the human-facing label used by the statusline. `examples` lists suggested knowledge filenames documented in the agent→examples table — they're suggestions for the user, not loaded at runtime and not written to disk. `tier` (`judgment` | `balanced` | `templated`) is the authored dial the packager projects into each harness's model/effort keys — never author raw `model:`/`effort:` in core frontmatter (see [Agent System](05-agent-system.md)).

2. **Verify the agent is discovered** — `bun -e "import { loadAgents } from 'core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts'; console.log(loadAgents().find(a => a.slug === '<slug>-agent'));"` should print the new agent's metadata.

3. **Verify intent creation creates the space knowledge dir** - `bun core/tools/aidlc-utility.ts intent-create --scope poc --project-dir /tmp/agent-smoke` should create the empty space-level `aidlc/knowledge/` directory (a sibling of the space's `intents/`). Creation does not seed per-agent subdirectories or READMEs - the team creates `aidlc/knowledge/<slug>-agent/` itself when it has content.

4. **Verify the statusline renders** — seed a state file with `Active Agent: <slug>-agent` and invoke the statusline hook; the output should include the display name after the `--` separator.

5. **Wire the agent into stages** — a new agent that should lead or support stages is named in each stage's frontmatter, in the `lead_agent` / `support_agents` fields of the stage `.md` files under `core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/`. Then run `aidlc engine graph compile` (and `compile --check` as the drift guard) to regenerate `tools/data/stage-graph.json` from that frontmatter. Do not hand-edit `stage-graph.json` — it is the compiled artifact, and the next `compile` overwrites any manual change. This is separate from discovery — `loadAgents()` makes the agent visible; the stage frontmatter (compiled into the graph) makes it active.

### What validates automatically

- `loadAgents()` discovers any new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` on next invocation — no code edit.
- The parser throws if `name` or `display_name` is missing, naming the file and the missing field.
- Agents are returned alphabetically sorted by slug, so `readdirSync` order on any platform produces the same output.
- Intent creation creates the empty space-level `aidlc/knowledge/` directory (it does not seed per-agent subdirectories or READMEs).
- Statusline rendering derives the display name from the same metadata source.
- `tests/unit/t61.test.ts` asserts all five properties end-to-end against a fixture agent.

### What does NOT validate automatically

- **Stage-graph participation**. Stage frontmatter references agents by slug in its `lead_agent` / `support_agents` fields, and `aidlc-graph.ts compile` carries those into `stage-graph.json`. Adding a new agent without naming it in any stage's frontmatter means the agent exists but never runs. Stage-graph schema validation (`core/tools/aidlc-stage-schema.ts`) is wired in: `aidlc-graph.ts compile` validates every stage's frontmatter (and `compile --check` is the CI drift guard), and `/aidlc --doctor` re-runs the same `validateStageFrontmatter` plus a "Graph references" check that every `lead_agent` / `support_agents` slug resolves.
- **Knowledge file existence**. `examples` is a list of suggested filenames documented in the agent→examples table — they're not created or validated. Users place the actual content in `aidlc/knowledge/<agent>/` (the space-level knowledge dir).
- **Doc tables listing agents**. The Phase Participation matrix at `docs/reference/05-agent-system.md:119-131` and the agent→examples table at `core/knowledge/aidlc-shared/knowledge-readme-template.md:16-29` are maintained by hand. Update them in the same PR that adds the agent (see Documentation Policy below).
- **`.claude/agents/<new-agent>.md` body content**. Only the frontmatter is parsed. The body prose (Core Responsibilities, Collaboration, optional Memory Focus, Key Principles) is read by the agent itself when activated — write it to match the existing agent files' structure.

## Documentation Policy

When adding, removing, or renaming files, directories, commands, or flags:

1. Grep `docs/` and `README.md` for stale references
2. Update all references in the same commit

## Authority Policy

Plan Approval, review, gate, and Unit lifecycle receipts bind to content and stage
attempt, never to the identity of the directive that issued a prompt and never to
event order. The two rules are stated in
[`12-state-machine.md`](12-state-machine.md#authority-invariants). Before
submitting, answer these:

1. Does this change add an input to any fingerprint, epoch, or receipt identity?
   Name the human-visible change that input detects. If no human action changes
   it (a re-run of `next`, a probe, a status query, a marker rewrite, a metadata
   refresh), it does not belong in an identity: record it as provenance instead.
2. Does this change make a query path write? `next`, the Stop-hook probe, the
   route check, `--status`, `--doctor`, and `team-board` never write authority
   state. The engine observers additionally hit a typed barrier at the durable
   write primitives, so an accidental write fails loudly rather than silently.
3. Does this change make a guard delete evidence? A guard's only move is to
   refuse. It does not clear a receipt, a challenge, or a marker to express a
   refusal, and only an explicit human decision withdraws a recorded one.
4. Does this change add a field to `aidlc-state.md`? A new field binds the active
   directive by default. Excluding it from the state digest is a deliberate
   classification of that field as cache, and it needs the same naming as item 1.

## Submitting Changes

1. Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why
2. Ensure L1 tests pass: `bash tests/run-tests.sh`
3. For hook changes: run `bash tests/run-tests.sh --unit`
4. For integration tests: run `bash tests/run-tests.sh --integration` (requires `claude` CLI tool)
5. Update documentation if your changes affect files, commands, or flags (see Documentation Policy above)
6. If the change adds an input to any fingerprint, epoch, or receipt identity, name the human-visible change it detects (see Authority Policy above)
