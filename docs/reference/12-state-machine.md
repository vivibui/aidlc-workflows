# State Machine

This chapter is the canonical reference for AI-DLC's state machines, the audit-event taxonomy, and the rule that connects them — **every state transition has exactly one tool-owned emitter**. Keeping this chapter's tables in sync with the code is enforced by the drift test at `tests/integration/t48-audit-event-emitters.test.ts`. If the doc and the code disagree, t48 fails.

Three nested state machines drive AI-DLC: **workflow**, **phase**, and **stage**. A fourth, independent stream records **session** events emitted by Claude Code hooks. These four streams share the intent's audit trail (the `audit/` shard dir under its record dir, `<record>/` = `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`) but are owned by different code paths, so it's easiest to read them as separate concerns and remember that their timelines interleave.

> **North-star invariant:** TypeScript owns deterministic bookkeeping; the LLM owns judgment. Every audit emission originates in a tool or hook, keeping LLM prose out of the emit path. If you're reading an MD file and see `aidlc-audit.ts append <EVENT>` as a prose instruction, that is a bug.
>
> **Authority binding:** a query never writes, and a guard never deletes evidence. Authority binds to content and attempt, never to issuance identity or event order. The ["Authority invariants" section](#authority-invariants) states both rules and names what they cover.
>
> **Audit-first atomicity:** tools emit their audit entries *before* mutating state. If audit emission fails, the tool throws before touching state — so `audit.md` and the state file never disagree. The ["Audit-first atomicity" section](#audit-first-atomicity) near the end of this chapter spells out the failure modes, plus the two exceptions: audit-of-intent (`WORKTREE_*`, `AUDIT_*`, `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED`) and the audit-**last** DocumentKB catalog events, whose artifact is derived and rebuildable.

## Why three state machines

A workflow completes by passing through phases; a phase completes by passing through its in-scope stages; a stage completes when its approval gate closes. Each layer owns a distinct decision:

- **Workflow** — is the overall job running, or done?
- **Phase** — is this lifecycle phase in progress, verified, or skipped because the scope excluded it?
- **Stage** — is the stage being worked on, waiting on the user, being revised after rejection, or complete?

Flattening them into one state field conflates those decisions. Separating them means `/aidlc --status` can answer "what's blocking this workflow?" in one read: workflow `Running`, phase `Active`, stage `[?]` → "awaiting your approval on \<stage\>".

## Workflow machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running : WORKFLOW_STARTED
    Running --> Completed : WORKFLOW_COMPLETED
    Completed --> [*]
```

<!-- Text fallback: initial state transitions to Running on WORKFLOW_STARTED; Running transitions to Completed on WORKFLOW_COMPLETED; Completed is terminal. -->

**Status values:** `Running`, `Completed`.

A workflow starts when the first intent is created (`aidlc-utility intent-create`, auto-invoked on the first `/aidlc` or via `/aidlc-init`) and ends when the last in-scope stage's approval gate closes. There is no `Paused` status and no `Waiting for Approval` status — approval is a stage-level concern, pause has no UX.

A workflow's `Running` state persists across Claude Code sessions. You start a workflow on Monday, stop the session, resume on Tuesday — the workflow is still `Running`; the *session* ended and a new one started.

| Transition | Trigger | Emitter |
|---|---|---|
| `[*] -> Running` | `aidlc-utility intent-create` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `Running -> Completed` | Final stage outcome reported through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |

---

## Phase machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Active : PHASE_STARTED
    Pending --> Skipped : PHASE_SKIPPED
    Active --> Verified : PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED
    Verified --> [*]
    Skipped --> [*]
    note right of Verified
        At a phase boundary, advance
        emits PHASE_COMPLETED +
        PHASE_VERIFIED + PHASE_STARTED
        (next phase) in one transaction.
    end note
```

<!-- Text fallback: initial state transitions to Pending; Pending transitions to Active on PHASE_STARTED; Pending transitions to Skipped on PHASE_SKIPPED; Active transitions to Verified on PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED. At a phase boundary, advance emits PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED + PHASE_STARTED (next phase) atomically, chaining Verified back to the next phase's Pending-to-Active transition. -->

**Status values:** `Pending`, `Active`, `Verified`, `Skipped`.

Phase state is tracked in the `## Phase Progress` section of `aidlc-state.md`. Intent creation seeds the section: `Initialization` lands `Verified` (creation completes every init stage before handing off), the first post-init stage's phase lands `Active`, and each later phase lands `Skipped` when the scope leaves it without EXECUTE stages (one `PHASE_SKIPPED` audit row each) or `Pending` otherwise. Phase completion fires both `PHASE_COMPLETED` and `PHASE_VERIFIED` at the phase boundary, then `PHASE_STARTED` for the next one, and the rows flip in the same state write. The section is display-only: routing reads `Lifecycle Phase` and the Stage Progress checkboxes, and `/aidlc --status` recomputes its phase block live.

| Transition | Trigger | Emitter |
|---|---|---|
| seed (`Verified`/`Active`/`Pending`/`Skipped`) | `aidlc-utility intent-create` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |
| `Active -> Verified` | Stage completion/skip reported through `aidlc-orchestrate.ts` at a phase boundary; forward `aidlc-jump execute` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter), `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` |
| `Pending -> Active` (boundary) | Engine routes after a reported outcome, or `aidlc-jump execute` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter), `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` |
| `Pending -> Skipped` (jumped over) | forward `aidlc-jump execute` past a whole phase | `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` |
| `Verified/Active -> Pending` reset | backward `aidlc-jump execute` (reset phases with EXECUTE stages) | `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` |
| `Pending <-> Skipped` re-derivation | `aidlc-utility scope-change` / `recompose` (not-yet-reached rows only) | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` |

At the init→post-init hand-off, `aidlc-utility intent-create` itself emits `PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED + PHASE_STARTED + STAGE_STARTED` after the final init stage so the audit trail captures the transition instead of going silent between creation and the first `advance`.

## Stage machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "[ ] Pending" as Pending
    state "[-] Active" as Active
    state "[?] AwaitingApproval" as Awaiting
    state "[R] Revising" as Revising
    state "[x] Completed" as Completed
    state "[S] Skipped" as Skipped

    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Active : STAGE_STARTED
    Active --> Awaiting : STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL
    Awaiting --> Completed : GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED
    Awaiting --> Revising : GATE_REJECTED + STAGE_REVISING
    Revising --> Awaiting : STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL
    Pending --> Skipped : STAGE_SKIPPED
    Active --> Skipped : STAGE_SKIPPED
    Revising --> Skipped : STAGE_SKIPPED
    Completed --> [*]
    Skipped --> [*]
```

<!-- Text fallback: [ ] Pending transitions to [-] Active on STAGE_STARTED. [-] Active transitions to [?] AwaitingApproval on STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL. [?] AwaitingApproval transitions to [x] Completed on GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED, or to [R] Revising on GATE_REJECTED + STAGE_REVISING. [R] Revising transitions back to [?] AwaitingApproval on STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL (re-entry). Any of Pending / Active / Revising can transition to [S] Skipped via STAGE_SKIPPED. -->

**Checkbox legend (in `aidlc-state.md`):**

| Checkbox | State | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[ ]` | `Pending` | Not started |
| `[-]` | `Active` | In progress |
| `[?]` | `AwaitingApproval` | Stage work done, gate open — user is the blocker |
| `[R]` | `Revising` | User rejected the gate — stage is being revised before re-entry |
| `[x]` | `Completed` | Approved and done |
| `[S]` | `Skipped` | Excluded by scope, skipped via jump, or cut mid-flight |

`[?]` and `[R]` disambiguate two situations that would otherwise both look like `[-]`. On resume, `[R]` tells the conductor to present the prior artifact and feedback before re-entering the gate, instead of re-executing the stage from scratch.

| Transition | Trigger | Emitter |
|---|---|---|
| `Pending → Active` | Engine routes after the previous reported outcome | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `Active → AwaitingApproval` | `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result awaiting-approval`; reviewer-bearing stages require a fresh terminal receipt before gate opening | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `AwaitingApproval → Completed` | `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result approved --user-input "<exact choice>"` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `AwaitingApproval → Revising` | `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result rejected --user-input <text>` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `Active → Revising` | The same rejected report when gate-open recovery is needed | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `Revising → AwaitingApproval` | `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result revised`; reviewer-bearing stages require a fresh post-rejection terminal receipt before gate re-entry | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal emitter) |
| `{Active,Revising} → Skipped` | `aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage <slug> --result skipped --reason <text>` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` (internal routed-skip emitter) |
| `Pending → Skipped` | Scope composition or `aidlc-jump execute` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` |

The `approved` report owns the full post-gate transition: it emits
`GATE_APPROVED + STAGE_COMPLETED`, then routes to the next in-scope stage,
emitting `STAGE_STARTED` plus any `PHASE_*` events at boundaries. On the final
in-scope stage it emits `PHASE_COMPLETED + PHASE_VERIFIED +
WORKFLOW_COMPLETED` and sets Status=Completed. The conductor does not call
state lifecycle verbs before or after reporting.

**Routed skip.** `report --result skipped` is accepted only on the main
workflow with an explicit nonblank `--stage` and `--reason`, when the named
stage is declared `execution: CONDITIONAL`, equals `Current Stage`, and is
Active or Revising. It runs before
artifact, per-unit, and ensemble-evidence guards because a justified skip owes
no completion evidence. The engine invokes the internal skip transition with
its routing marker: the transaction preserves `[S]`, emits exactly one
`STAGE_SKIPPED`, never emits `STAGE_COMPLETED`, and either starts the next
stage (including boundary events) or completes the workflow. If onward routing
fails, recovery leaves the skipped marker and cursor at the same stage so the
route can be retried without duplicating the skip event. `report --single
--result skipped` is rejected.

**Artifact guard (issue #366).** Every report outcome that marks a stage `[x]`
runs a deterministic artifact check before completing it, so a stage cannot be
marked complete without evidence of work on disk. A stage that declares
`produces[]` must have at least one of those artifacts present under the active
intent's record dir or its per-unit Construction directories. A codekb stage
is stricter: every registered repository directory must contain the full
declared `produces[]` set; single/unrecorded intents use the one resolved
codekb directory. `workspace_requires: true` also requires source-work evidence
outside `aidlc/` and the harness dir. A failure writes nothing. Optional outputs
do not participate. For `produces_kinds`, units whose kind prunes the required
set to zero owe no artifact; any applicable unit remains strict. Bypass with
`AIDLC_SKIP_ARTIFACT_GUARD=1`. The same switch also bypasses the review logger's
required-output existence check; without it, a stage-level review of a
per-Unit stage requires every authoritative Unit's applicable required outputs.
When no authored Unit DAG exists but the current attempt has merged Bolt rows,
the stage-level review fingerprint instead enumerates exactly those merged
Units. A Bolt merge is proven, not asserted: `aidlc-bolt complete --merge`
emits `BOLT_COMPLETED` before the state and audit merges run, so a slug-backed
(worktree) attempt counts as merged only once a matching later `AUDIT_MERGED`
receipt confirms the merge sequence landed on main; a name-only, non-worktree
Bolt's `BOLT_COMPLETED` remains terminal. A completion still awaiting merge
evidence stays on the open path, a slugless completion cannot close a
slug-backed attempt, and a later fragment-cleanup `BOLT_FAILED` cannot erase a
confirmed merge. `AUDIT_MERGED` itself carries no reviewer authority: a
same-second row in another audit shard never makes a review request, verdict,
or receipt ambiguous. An open Bolt remains on the ordinary stage-level fallback
path because
its Unit artifacts still live outside the main tree. Merging that Bolt changes
the fingerprint domain and intentionally invalidates an earlier stage-level
receipt until its exact pending ordinal is rebound with `--retry-pending`.
Per-Unit receipt filtering still recognizes both open and merged Units. A Unit
may belong to both sets when an older attempt merged while a newer attempt
remains open; merged membership drives gate demand and stage-level
fingerprinting, while the union drives receipt filtering.

**Reviewer gate guard (issue #551).** A reviewer-bearing stage cannot enter
`AwaitingApproval` through `gate-start` or `revise` until its configured
reviewer has a fresh terminal `REVIEW_COMPLETED` receipt. The same receipt
remains mandatory on all four completion paths. Re-reporting an already-open
gate re-runs these guards without writing a duplicate transition. A rejection
reported directly from `Active` moves to `Revising` without fabricating a
`STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL` row. Synthetic transition tests that deliberately
isolate another guard may set
`AIDLC_SKIP_REVIEWER_GATE_GUARD=1`; this bypass applies only to gate opening,
never to `approve`, `advance`, `finalize`, or `complete-workflow`. The adjacent
summary-confirmation test bypass is
`AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD=1`.

**Ensemble evidence gate.** On a `mob` or `subagent`-with-supports stage, the
report path refuses `awaiting-approval`, `revised`, and `approved` while a
declared support agent's contribution file
(`<stage>/contributions/<agent-slug>.md`) is missing or lacks its
`**Collaborator:**` identity-marker first line — the deterministic proof the
ensemble actually convened. A settled autonomous swarm is exempt (its per-unit
convergence ledger is the evidence); `report --single` checks stage-level
evidence only. On `mode: pipeline`, the same report outcomes and every direct
completing transition require an ordered, current-attempt
`PIPELINE_LINK_COMPLETED` receipt for every lead/support link. Multi-repo
reverse engineering requires a complete chain per scanned repo; a current-attempt
repo-scoped `ARTIFACT_REUSED` row with `Decision=keep` exempts a reused repo.
Isolated rows carry `Workflow: single-stage:<slug>` and are accepted only while
the complete graph-declared Reverse Engineering artifact set remains valid and
the store remains `CURRENT`;
while `modify`/`redo` rows do not. A rejection, jump, or later stage start resets
the main-workflow evidence, and isolated `--single` link rows never satisfy it. Bypass with
`AIDLC_DISABLE_ENSEMBLE_EVIDENCE=1`, intended only for recovering a
legitimately-run stage whose contribution files or in-flight link receipts were
lost.

**Source freshness and per-unit attribution (#629/#646/#662).** On a
`workspace_requires` stage, every terminal review still carries the workspace-
global `Source Fingerprint`; the newest modern binding is normally the outer
post-review-mutation boundary on all four completion routes. Per-unit receipts
add `Unit Source Fingerprint`, which binds the raw bytes of the unit's strict
`source-manifest.json` and the current content of every exact/directory claim.
Receipts are evaluated newest-first, so a newer validated claimant may shield
an older receipt for an intentional shared path. An uncovered edit, deletion,
or new path in an exact/directory claim invalidates only the owning unit and
enters that unit's one bounded `stale-receipt` recovery.

`WORKFLOW_STARTED`, `STAGE_JUMPED`, and a `workspace_requires`
`STAGE_STARTED` record content-addressed source-listing baselines. After every
applicable unit has fresh modern evidence, completion compares baseline to the
current listing and refuses any changed application-source path outside the
fresh claims union. Unit-major Construction always uses the workflow/jump
boundary because source work can precede its late `STAGE_STARTED`. Equal-second
cross-shard rows that would decide a boundary or newest claimant fail closed
instead of trusting shard filename order.

A rejection resets review and run-floor accounting but never replaces that
completion baseline: otherwise any unclaimed path present at rejection would be
grandfathered into the next attempt. When the prior attempt has a validated
`SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` chain, `GATE_REJECTED` carries only its final
`Prior Accepted Source Fingerprint`. The next attempt's first source merge must
start from that aggregate, while completion continues to compare against the
original stage-entry baseline.

There is one narrowly bounded reconciliation of the global boundary: if an
unclaimed baseline change — addition, modification, or deletion — is fully
reverted, completion may proceed only when the effective baseline snapshot is
present and valid, every applicable unit still has a fresh modern unit binding,
and the baseline-to-current delta contains zero unclaimed paths. This proves
that the transient unclaimed change is gone. Any ordinary post-review edit,
stale or legacy unit binding, missing evidence, or remaining unclaimed delta
still takes the normal global-first refusal path.

The fingerprint and canonical per-path listing come from one bounded filesystem
walk, independent of repository metadata and Git executable availability.
Ordinary and ignored application bytes, external source-symlink targets, and
workspace-roof files remain bound. Framework state, exact sensor caches, VCS
metadata, dependency/cache directories or symlinks, and unregistered
`build/`, `coverage/`, `dist/`, `logs/`, `target/`, and `tmp/` directories or
symlinks remain outside the source boundary.

Real source beneath a conditional generated-output directory, including binary
or extensionless source, can be declared in root `.aidlc-source-paths.json`:

```json
{"version":1,"paths":["dist/worker.js","build/source"]}
```

Registered paths are content-bound regardless of encoding and are included in
the canonical listing and autonomous swarm Source Commit. Absolute, traversing,
framework, sensor-cache, and dependency/cache paths are rejected. Missing
registered repositories contribute an explicit marker; unreadable, unstable,
over-budget, or malformed boundaries remain `unbindable` and fail closed.

Migration is deliberate: a pre-upgrade workflow with no baseline skips the
unclaimed check, and a fieldless per-unit receipt retains the #629 global
policy. A present but `unbindable`, missing, or corrupt modern baseline/unit
snapshot fails closed. `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` bypasses both global and
per-unit checks; missing/invalid-manifest receipts explicitly record
`Unit Source Binding Bypass: true`, so the switch must be present again at
completion. In a modern Bolt, finalize also verifies the attested base-to-
worktree footprint is a subset of the reviewed manifest claims before the
settled-swarm stage-level exemption applies.

Swarm footprint verification and immutable Source Commit creation apply the
same boundary. Clean-filter raw-byte replacement is restricted to exact
filesystem-included regular paths, so excluded generated or framework files
cannot re-enter after shaping. New-submodule recovery shares one 30-second
cumulative deadline and a 32-proof cap across the entire `finalize` call, in
addition to the per-command, ref-count, refspec-size, recursion, and
materialized-checkout bounds. `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` disables the
check; a bypassed finalize records `Source Freshness Bypass: true`, and merge
must repeat the same switch.

**Gate-revision backstop.** If the conductor revises an artifact at an open
gate without first reporting rejection, the `approved` report reconciles the
missing `GATE_REJECTED` + `STAGE_REVISING` pair before completion when audit
evidence proves a post-gate human turn followed by an artifact write. The
backfilled rows carry `Recovered: true`; reviewer writes before the human turn
do not count. Reviewer-bearing stages persist `[R]` after that recovered
rejection and require a fresh review plus the normal `revised` report before
the gate can reopen. Bypass with `AIDLC_SKIP_REVISION_BACKSTOP=1`.

**Park (issue #365/#367).** `aidlc-orchestrate park` writes a `Parked` / `Parked At Stage` runtime marker (via `aidlc-state.ts park`, which emits `WORKFLOW_PARKED`) without advancing any stage; a subsequent plain `next` re-emits a terminal `parked` directive and the Stop hook lets the turn end, so a long workflow can pause across sessions instead of rubber-stamping the remaining stages to reach `done`. `/aidlc --resume` clears the marker (`unpark` emits `WORKFLOW_UNPARKED`) before continuing. An unattended autonomous Construction run (`Construction Autonomy Mode: autonomous`) refuses to park: both the tool and the Stop hook's `parked` allow decline under autonomous mode, so the loop keeps moving with no human to resume it.

### Revision loop

```
report awaiting-approval  →  [?] AwaitingApproval
          ↘ report rejected  →  [R] Revising  (Revision Count += 1)
                   ↓ report revised
                   [?] AwaitingApproval
                   ↘ report approved  →  [x] Completed
```

`Revision Count` lives in the state file and increments on each rejected
report. The conductor uses this to detect the revision-loop escape hatch
(default is 3 cycles before offering to skip).

When a revision changes a `produces[]` artifact on a stage whose directive
carries a reviewer, the conductor re-runs the `stage-protocol-reviewer.md` §12a step before
reporting `revised` (stage-protocol Part 0). The engine verifies the fresh
terminal receipt before accepting the `revised` report and re-opening the gate.

## Session stream (hook-owned, independent)

Session events are emitted by Claude Code hooks, not by AI-DLC tools. A session is a single Claude Code conversation; a workflow is a long-lived directory state. The relationship is many-to-many — one workflow can span multiple sessions, one session can touch multiple workflows — so the streams are independent by design.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_STARTED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` | `SessionStart` with `source=startup` or `clear` |
| `SESSION_RESUMED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` | `SessionStart` with `source=resume` |
| `SESSION_COMPACTED` | `hooks/aidlc-validate-state.ts` | `PreCompact` — fires at compaction time so it's captured reliably |
| `SESSION_ENDED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-end.ts` | `SessionEnd` |

Session hooks check for the active intent's `aidlc-state.md` (under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`) before emitting. If no such file exists (no active AI-DLC workflow in the cwd), the hook exits silently without writing to any audit log. Session events exist to annotate an active workflow's timeline — a session in a directory with no workflow has nothing to annotate.

### Compaction awareness

`aidlc-state.ts resume` scans the audit tail for the latest `SESSION_COMPACTED`. If no stage activity (`STAGE_STARTED`, `STAGE_COMPLETED`, `GATE_APPROVED`, `SESSION_RESUMED`, `RECOVERY_COMPLETED`) follows it, resume returns `compaction_pending: true` and the conductor surfaces a three-option prompt (continue / review / restart) before proceeding. `RECOVERY_COMPLETED` is emitted by `acknowledge-compaction` once the user picks an option, satisfying the activity gate so subsequent compactions detect a fresh boundary.

---

## Audit event taxonomy

**95 events**, grouped below into 19 categories (the canonical `audit-format.md` registry splits the same 95 into 23 - the grouping is presentational, the event set is the invariant). Every event has exactly one tool or hook emitter, except for events pre-registered for an upcoming release whose Emitter cell reads `Reserved (v0.4.0 PR N)`, `Reserved (v0.5.0 PR N)`, or `Reserved (v0.6.0 PR N)` - these are skipped by the drift test's forward check until the consumer PR ships the emitter. The drift test `tests/integration/t48-audit-event-emitters.test.ts` enforces forward/reverse/tertiary/pairing/MD-MD consistency between this chapter's tables and the code.

### Workflow lifecycle

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKFLOW_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | Mandatory first event on every intent creation |
| `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` |  |
| `WORKFLOW_PARKED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `park` - workflow parked mid-flow for a later session; no stage advanced |
| `WORKFLOW_UNPARKED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `unpark` - park marker cleared on explicit `--resume` re-entry |

### Phase lifecycle

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PHASE_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | First fire in init; subsequent fires at stage-tool phase boundaries |
| `PHASE_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | Paired with `PHASE_VERIFIED` at every boundary |
| `PHASE_VERIFIED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts`, `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | Always paired with `PHASE_COMPLETED` |
| `PHASE_SKIPPED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | One per scope-excluded phase, emitted at intent creation |

### Stage lifecycle

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STAGE_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-utility.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | Internal route marks `[ ]` → `[-]` |
| `STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | Internal emitter for `report --result awaiting-approval` / `revised`; recovered rows carry `Recovered=true`; an authorized blocking-sensor override records sensor ids, optional detail paths, and evaluation reasons |
| `STAGE_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | Internal emitter for a completed/approved report; never paired with a skipped report |
| `STAGE_REVISING` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | Internal emitter paired with `GATE_REJECTED` after a rejected report |
| `STAGE_SKIPPED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | Exactly one per `[S]` transition; the main-workflow report path routes onward atomically |
| `STAGE_JUMPED` | `tools/aidlc-jump.ts` | Records the destination slug on `--stage`/`--phase` jump. Backward jumps also bind the concrete changed upstream artifact paths and the downstream artifact/review paths invalidated by the reset. |

### Gate decisions

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GATE_APPROVED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-unit.ts gate` | `--user-input` captures the exact choice. On reviewer-backed gates, the same atomic row stores content-addressed `Accepted risk` dispositions for every current open finding. Unit merge gates also bind Pinned OID, Attempt Generation, Strategy, and Target branch. |
| `GATE_REJECTED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts`, `tools/aidlc-unit.ts gate` | `--feedback` captures the rejection reason. Explicit `--reject-finding <review-artifact>#R-NN=<reason>` values store content-addressed `Rejected: <reason>` dispositions; generic revision feedback does not reject a finding. Unit merge gates bind the same pinned transaction fields. |

Under `Unit Ownership: team`, these rows additionally carry `Unit`, `Gate
Scope`, and `Gate Stages`. Per-stage approval settles only that `(stage, Unit)`;
unit-end approval settles the Unit chain. A Unit-tagged rejection floors
lifecycle and review receipts only for that Unit (all Gate Stages for unit-end);
legacy Unit-less rows retain stage-global behavior.

### User interaction

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DECISION_RECORDED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Fires before a non-gate `AskUserQuestion` so options are captured |
| `QUESTION_ANSWERED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Fires after a non-gate question response; approval choices are lifecycle events owned by `report` |
| `SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_RECORDED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Human-backed consolidated-summary receipt; new rows carry `Hash Scope: confirmed-content-v1`, which preserves the canonical order of the preamble and all visible Q<n> and feedback sections, including follow-up questions after an assumption decision. Exactly one post-summary `Assumption Confirmation` section and its contents are excluded; a same-named pre-summary section remains hashed. Any other visible Markdown or raw-HTML heading after the summary fails closed. Stage-specific pre-summary headings remain valid. Unscoped receipts retain legacy whole-file verification and need reconfirmation after an allowed append. A `Looks correct` receipt also carries `Summary Authorization Id`, the authorization the confirmation minted (a digest of the attempt, stage, Unit, workflow, questions path, confirmed content, and choice); the same id becomes the scope's active authorization under `<record>/.aidlc-summary-authorization/`, and a `Request changes` reply withdraws it. Reserved from public audit append. |
| `PLAN_APPROVAL_RECORDED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Human-backed Code Generation plan receipt. The authority it records binds to intent, stage or Unit target, stage attempt (run floor), content fingerprint (the projected plan and instructions plus the Testing Contract hash), prompt (the questions file with answers blanked), and session response, never to the identity of the directive that presented the question nor to row order. The row also carries the directive epoch and the raw questions-file digest (`Questions SHA-256`) as provenance; both are recorded and never compared, so a note appended to the questions file after approval leaves the decision standing while a change to the prompt the human saw retires it. Protected runtime state is the authority; this row is provenance only. |
| `PLAN_APPROVAL_OVERRIDDEN` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | The human-only break-glass exit for Plan Approval. Fires only when the human typed `Override Plan Approval: <reason>` as a prompt (the human-turn hook records that typed text under the session; a picked option never does), the conductor ran `answer --checkpoint plan-approval --override "<reason>"` with the same reason, and the normal receipt path refused. Carries `Reason`, `Failed Checks` (what the normal path refused), `Session`, `Unit` or `stage-level`, and `Fingerprint`; the paired `PLAN_APPROVAL_RECORDED` row carries `Override: yes`. The receipt it accompanies binds to plan content and stage attempt only, so no later check compares its source. The typed request is single-use and the conductor never proposes or initiates it |
| `REVIEW_REQUESTED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Fires when the conductor dispatches the reviewer defined by `stage-protocol-reviewer.md` §12a. The stage's required `review_artifact` scalar names the Markdown output the review is about; plugin-added outputs and produces ordering cannot change it. A new `--unit` request must name a member of the authoritative DAG or a Unit proven by a matching open or merge-confirmed tool-owned Bolt attempt in the current no-DAG attempt; a completion still awaiting its `AUDIT_MERGED` merge evidence, like a historyless Unit, refuses. A single stable file-identity snapshot records every declared artifact exactly as dispatched (`Artifact Fingerprint`) and the request-time workspace source for `workspace_requires` stages; the row mints a `Request Id` that the completion row and the review record echo. The command's JSON returns `requestId` and `reviewFile`, the slot under `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/` where the reviewer writes its review; the request opens that slot, removing a draft an earlier incomplete dispatch of the same iteration left. `--retry-pending` re-issues one unmatched request with the original binding and request id when the artifacts and source still match; a request recorded before request ids or source binding gains them through that one retry, marked `Upgrade: legacy-request`. Rows written under the retired appendix protocol also carry `Review Appendix Artifact`, `Review Appendix Offset`, `Review Appendix Prior Digest`, `Review Appendix Prior Length`, and `Review Challenge`; they stay readable and a completion of such a request echoes them unchanged. |
| `REVIEW_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Fires only after a matching positive-iteration request. One coherent artifact snapshot must reproduce the requested bytes exactly: the reviewer writes no artifact, so `Request Fingerprint` and `Artifact Fingerprint` are the same identity. The review is read from the request's review file (or `--review-file`), validated with Bun's Markdown parser (one rendered Verdict matching `--verdict`, one Reviewer, one Iteration, no later Markdown or raw-HTML H1/H2; literal examples in fenced/inline code and HTML comments carry no authority, while list/blockquote/table containers cannot mint ownership), and written as the review record `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/stage/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` or `<record>/.aidlc-reviews/<stage>/units/<unit>/<attempt>/<iteration>.json` in the same locked transaction; the row names it (`Review Record`) and pins its bytes (`Review Record Digest`), and echoes the `Request Id`. Request-time and completion source fingerprints use the same Git-independent bounded filesystem identity and must match. Deprecated for this release cycle: a verdict is still accepted from a terminal `## Review` section a reviewer appended to `review_artifact` after the request (the bytes before it are the requested bytes and the request saw no appendix); that validated section is copied into the review record. A retried incomplete review may record `NOT-READY` with an empty review record. A malformed row is ignored and does not consume its pending request. |
| `PIPELINE_LINK_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-log.ts` | Fires after one declared pipeline link returns. Carries `Stage`, `Link`, and `Position k/N`; multi-repo chains also carry `Repo`, and isolated runs carry `Workflow=single-stage:<slug>`. The tool refuses undeclared, duplicate, or out-of-order links within that receipt scope. Main-workflow gate-start, approval, advance, finalize, and workflow completion ignore isolated rows and require every scanned-repo current-attempt link receipt. |

### Unit lifecycle (inline per-unit Construction stages)

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `UNIT_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `unit start` — requires the exact stage/Unit pair currently routed by the engine, a safe Unit identifier from the authoritative DAG (including safe legacy spellings), and no other open Unit |
| `UNIT_PAUSED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `unit pause` — requires `--reason` and `--next-action`; the engine routes the paused unit first and hard-stops until an explicit resume |
| `UNIT_RESUMED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `unit resume` — only the currently-paused unit can resume |
| `UNIT_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | Serial `unit complete` verifies the active unit's required artifacts. Wave `unit complete --wave` instead verifies the engine still exposes that entry as build-complete/review-settled, copies new Unit diary entries into the parent diary with deterministic markers, binds the receipt to the final artifact fingerprint, then commits without opening a single-active checkpoint. All lifecycle rows carry an exact boundary-event/timestamp/ordinal `Run floor` (or a fail-closed cross-shard ambiguity token); receipt mode stays enabled across attempts, so stale, changed, ambiguous, reopened, or not-yet-fanned-in Units block the gate until they complete again. |
| `UNIT_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | Main landed the pinned candidate content, received the team's audit shard, and folded this Unit's derived row. Fields bind the row to Unit, owner, pinned candidate OID, merge commit OID, and attempt generation. |

Team-owned unit-major runs add a derived `## Unit Progress` table to state. The
engine rewrites it from these receipts, artifacts, reviews, Unit gate rows, and
`UNIT_MERGED` receipts on each `next`; it is not an authority and manual cells
are ignored. Once a pinned merge transaction or `UNIT_MERGED` receipt exists, a
`merged` column prevents the per-unit block from settling until every merge-bound
row has landed. Claims alone retain the increment-2 projection without this
column.

### Scope and configuration

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SCOPE_DETECTED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `detect-scope` subcommand; `Source` field records provenance (freeform / keyword / env / cli) |
| `SCOPE_CHANGED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `scope-change` subcommand on active workflow |
| `PLUGIN_SELECTION_CHANGED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `select-plugins` set-mode; fields: `Previous Selection`, `New Selection` |
| `DEPTH_CHANGED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `config set depth <value>` / `config-change --depth` |
| `TEST_STRATEGY_CHANGED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `config set test-strategy <value>` / `config-change --test-strategy` |
| `UNIT_OWNERSHIP_SET` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `set-unit-ownership team|solo`; team requires unit-major |
| `UNIT_GATE_RHYTHM_SET` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `set-unit-gate-rhythm per-stage|unit-end`; team mode only |
| `REVIEW_CLASS_CHANGED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `config set review <value>` / `config-change --review` / a combined `scope-change --review` set or cleared the per-run review override |
| `RECOMPOSED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `recompose` subcommand - the adaptive composer's in-flight plan re-shape (pending-stage suffix flips under the audit lock) |
| `CHANGE_CONTROL_SET` | `tools/aidlc-lib.ts` | The intent's Change Control value moved: the `change-control <strict\|relaxed>` verb (behind `/aidlc --change-control` and the plain-chat request), a `scope-change` carrying a scope-supplied value to the new scope's default, or a governed checkpoint observing a memory-layer edit. Fields: `Old Value`, `New Value`, `Source` (`you`, `scope <name>`, `<layer>.md`) |
| `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` | `tools/aidlc-lib.ts` | A governed checkpoint (plan-approval source drift, review-receipt content change, summary-confirmation authorization) accepted an input change under `relaxed` and continued. Fields: `Stage`, optional `Unit`, `Checkpoint`, `Changed`, `Recorded`, `Current`, `Details` (the one line the human hears). One row per distinct change; the same values never produce a second row |

Change Control decides the consequence of an input change after a human approval or confirmation (`strict` reopens the approval with the existing remedy, `relaxed` records the change and continues); it never removes a gate, never alters a reviewer's verdict, and never deletes evidence. The value is read only where such a change is met (the three governed checkpoints), by the `change-control` verb, by `intent-create`, and by `/aidlc --status`; a check that meets no change reads nothing. An invalid memory `Mode:` value is a validation error naming the file and the two allowed values at each of those reads, so a stage whose inputs did not change is not stopped by it.

### Artifacts

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ARTIFACT_CREATED` | `hooks/aidlc-write-audit-log.ts` | Write to net-new path, distinguished from UPDATED via `mtimeMs == birthtimeMs` stat check. Carries `Summary Authorization Id` when the written stage and Unit have an active summary confirmation, so completion can ask whether the output descends from the current confirmation |
| `ARTIFACT_UPDATED` | `hooks/aidlc-write-audit-log.ts` | Edit tool or Write overwriting existing file. Same `Summary Authorization Id` stamp as `ARTIFACT_CREATED` |
| `ARTIFACT_REUSED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `reuse-artifact` subcommand — keep/modify/redo decisions; optional `Repo` scopes evidence to one registered repo, optional `--single` binds it to the open synthetic attempt, but only `keep` with a complete authoritative artifact set and still-`CURRENT` isolated Reverse Engineering store grants that pipeline exemption |

### Construction Bolts

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BOLT_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` | Accepts CSV bolt names for parallel batches; a modern `--worktree` row propagates the immutable Base commit and content-addressed raw-aware Base Source Listing attested at worktree creation |
| `BOLT_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` | Paired with a prior `BOLT_STARTED` |
| `BOLT_FAILED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` (`fail` + `abort`) | `--succeeded-siblings` captures parallel-batch survivors; `abort` adds `Reason: aborted` field for sub-classification |
| `AUTONOMY_MODE_SET` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` | Atomically updates `Construction Autonomy Mode` field; validates field exists first (audit-first) |

### Session

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_STARTED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` | `source=startup` or `clear` |
| `SESSION_RESUMED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-start.ts` | `source=resume` |
| `SESSION_COMPACTED` | `hooks/aidlc-validate-state.ts` | Emitted at PreCompact (not at next SessionStart) to avoid duplication |
| `SESSION_ENDED` | `hooks/aidlc-session-end.ts` | Includes `Reason` field from Claude Code |
| `HUMAN_TURN` | `hooks/aidlc-record-human-turn.ts` (+ per-harness prompt-submit adapters) | One per observed prompt-submit or answered-widget seam unless the driver declares `AIDLC_UNATTENDED=1`; the approval/interview gate requires one since the last gate resolution. This is presence/freshness evidence, not an authenticated transcript or proof that later caller-supplied decision text was authored by the human. |
| `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` | `hooks/aidlc-log-subagent.ts` | Records subagent completion via SubagentStop hook |
| `REVIEWER_SCOPE_BLOCKED` | `hooks/aidlc-reviewer-scope.ts` | A per-unit reviewer's tool call refused for reaching into sibling units' `construction/` paths (the reviewer-module read-scope bound); one row per refusal |
| `REVIEW_FREEZE_BLOCKED` | `hooks/aidlc-review-freeze.ts` | A file-tool or shell `produces[]` write refused because it would invalidate a fresh terminal review receipt before the gate (READY or terminal NOT-READY under the effective class); one row per refusal |
| `PLAN_APPROVAL_BLOCKED` | `hooks/aidlc-plan-approval-guard.ts` | A code-generation developer-agent dispatch or workspace mutation refused because the active unit or zero-Unit stage target lacked a current fingerprinted plan, test instructions, Testing Contract, explicit approval, or matching worker-brief marker; one row per refusal |
| `GUARD_DISABLED` | `hooks/aidlc-plan-approval-guard.ts` | A tool call passed the Plan Approval guard because its deterministic off-switch environment variable was set while a workflow existed. Carries `Guard` (`plan-approval-guard`) and `Tool`; one row per streak, appended only when the newest row in the active shard is not already this event for the same guard |

### Diagnostics and workspace

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HEALTH_CHECKED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | `--doctor` run |
| `WORKSPACE_SCAFFOLDED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | Net-new directory tree created by init |
| `WORKSPACE_SCANNED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | Brownfield workspace detection complete |
| `WORKSPACE_INITIALISED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | State file materialized |

### Documents

The DocumentKB is space-level, so all three land in one space-level shard even for
an intent-scoped document — the intent UUID is a field on the event, not the shard
selector.

That shard is **`spaces/<space>/intents/audit/`**, not `spaces/<space>/audit/`. The
`intents/` segment is inherited from `intentsDir()`, which is where every shard in a
space lives; the space-level shard is a sibling of the per-intent record dirs rather
than a directory one level up. An earlier version of this line documented the
shorter path, which does not exist on disk — measured by onboarding a document and
finding the written shard.

Workflow-authority readers enumerate only the resolved intent's shards. Consumers
that need space-level provenance request it explicitly; `--doctor --export` does so
and reads the space shard before the resolved intent shards, keeping document events
visible without widening lifecycle authority beyond the intent ledger.

All three ship with `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` (DocumentKB S1). Emitting verbs per event are listed in each row below — `onboard`, `sync`, `associate`, `dissociate`, `rebind`, and `summarize` all emit.

| Event | Emitter | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCUMENT_INDEXED` | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` | From `onboard` and from `sync`'s fresh-document branch: a customer document entered the DocumentKB for the first time **Audit-last** (see "Audit-last for derived catalogs"): emitted only after every catalog write succeeds. |
| `DOCUMENT_UPDATED` | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` | From `associate`, `dissociate`, `rebind`, `summarize` (`Change: summarized`), `onboard`'s edited-row branch, and `sync`'s moved/changed/retried branches: a new revision, re-extraction, move, summary publication, or intent-association change. A normal no-op emits nothing. An idempotent retry may emit `Change: audit-repair` or the missing association delta when it detects that a prior audit-last call committed the catalog but failed before provenance; this records the already-committed state rather than a new user mutation. **Audit-last** (see "Audit-last for derived catalogs"): emitted only after every catalog write succeeds. |
| `DOCUMENT_REMOVED` | `tools/aidlc-knowledge.ts` | From `sync`: the original is gone, so the row is tombstoned and extracted content deleted. The `metadata.json` tombstone is kept, so a later index rebuild does not resurrect the row as absent **Audit-last** (see "Audit-last for derived catalogs"): emitted only after every catalog write succeeds. |

All three land in the **space-level** audit shard even when the document is scoped to
an intent: a document outlives any intent, and its scope can move later, so filing
its provenance under whichever intent happened to be active would split one
document's history across shards and make it unreconstructible.

### Error and recovery

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `ERROR_LOGGED` | `tools/aidlc-lib.ts` (via `emitError` from every tool's `error()`) | Any tool CLI that calls `error(msg)` to exit non-zero; best-effort — no-op if no workflow in cwd, guarded against recursion |
| `RECOVERY_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | `acknowledge-compaction --choice <continue|review|restart>` called by the conductor after the user answers the compaction-awareness AskUserQuestion |

### Worktree

Pre-registered for v0.4.0; the three `WORKTREE_*` rows ship with `aidlc-worktree.ts` (milestone 7); `STATE_*` lands in milestone 9 (state fork/merge); `AUDIT_*` lands in milestone 10 (audit fork/merge). t48 forward check skips rows whose Emitter cell still reads `Reserved`.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKTREE_CREATED` | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` | Audit-first per-Bolt creation records the immutable Base commit, `Base Source Listing`, and portable creating-repo selector (`Repo`, `-` for root); private worktree metadata also binds the canonical Git common-dir. Swarm prepare additionally stamps intent/Unit/batch/stage/floor provenance (subcommand: `create`) |
| `WORKTREE_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` | Bolt's worktree merged back to main on gate approval (subcommand: `merge`) |
| `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` | Aborted Bolt's worktree explicitly removed (subcommand: `discard`) |
| `STATE_FORKED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | State file forked to worktree on Bolt start (subcommand: `fork`) |
| `STATE_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` | Worktree's state merged back to main on gate approval; alphabetical-slug tiebreak as defence-in-depth (subcommand: `merge`) |
| `AUDIT_FORKED` | `tools/aidlc-audit.ts` (`audit-fork`) | Audit log forked to worktree on Bolt start; audit-of-intent — emit precedes the byte-copy |
| `AUDIT_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-audit.ts` (`audit-merge`) | Worktree's audit entries appended to main audit on gate approval; per-Bolt entry order preserved, cross-Bolt order reflects merge-completion order. Under the same lock, before any row lands, the review records named by the delta's `REVIEW_COMPLETED` rows are carried into the main intent record: only for a completion that descends from a `REVIEW_REQUESTED` row in the same delta, read without following symlinks, refused when hardlinked, oversize, or not hashing to the pinned digest, and never overwriting a record already present with different bytes. A merge that cannot carry a record refuses. |

### Practices

Pre-registered for v0.4.0; emitters land in milestone 8 (stage 2.2 practices-discovery) and milestone 13 (Construction orchestrator runtime).

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `PRACTICES_DISCOVERED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type discovered` | Greenfield or brownfield lead draft + three spokes + human interview + lead integration completed; drafts await affirmation |
| `PRACTICES_AFFIRMED` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-promote` | Team approved practices; content promoted from the intent's `inception/practices-discovery/` to `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/team.md` and `project.md` |
| `PRACTICES_OVERRIDE` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-promote` (write-failure path) and `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type override` (bolt-plan-marker-conflict path) | Either promotion failed and the stage remains awaiting approval, or the active-space walking-skeleton stance overrode the current Bolt's marker |
| `PRACTICES_SECTION_EMPTY` | `tools/aidlc-state.ts` `practices-event --type empty` | Conductor read a practices section that returned empty; advisory-only, falls back to org defaults |

### Merge dispatch

Pre-registered for v0.4.0 in milestone 1; emitters land in milestone 13 via the new `aidlc-bolt dispatch-event` subcommand. The conductor brackets each aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent dispatch — pre-call INVOKED, post-call RETURNED on successful YAML parse, FALLBACK on timeout / malformed-YAML / low-confidence.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED` | Conductor dispatched aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent via Task to determine merge strategy from team practices prose |
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` | Agent returned parsed YAML with strategy, target branch, confidence, and notes |
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event --event MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` | Agent timed out or returned malformed YAML; conductor fell back to org defaults — critical observability hook |

### Sensors

The sensor dispatcher emits the four `SENSOR_*` events and doctor emits the paired-coverage `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` row. Write-fired sensors dispatch from PostToolUse on matching paths. Gate-fired sensors dispatch once per existing declared deliverable before initial, revised, or approve-backstop recovered gate entry. A blocking binding proceeds only on a verified pass; findings, unavailable execution, malformed/mismatched verdicts, and budget overruns refuse. An override requires the logged offered choice, a human turn, the exact answer receipt, and matching `--user-input`; autonomous mode cannot override. Explicit and discovered artifact paths are canonically confined to the stage produce directories. Blocking declarations on write-fired sensors remain advisory in this release.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `SENSOR_FIRED` | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` | Dispatcher invoked a sensor against a stage output from a matching Write/Edit or gate-boundary dispatch |
| `SENSOR_PASSED` | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` | Sensor completed and reported no findings (also covers tool-unavailable and script-error fall-through; `Note` field discriminates) |
| `SENSOR_FAILED` | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` | Sensor completed and reported findings; detail file written at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/<stage-slug>/<sensor-id>-<fire-id>.md` (in the intent's record dir) |
| `SENSOR_BUDGET_OVERRIDE` | `tools/aidlc-sensor.ts` `fire` | Sensor exceeded its configured cap (registry / binding / depth-derived per the three-layer cap model) and was terminated or skipped |
| `GUARDRAIL_LOADED` | `tools/aidlc-utility.ts` | Guardrail loader resolved the scope-hierarchical guardrail set for the active workflow (org → project → phase → stage); doctor's paired-coverage check reads from this event |

### Learning loop

Pre-registered for v0.5.0 in milestone 4; `MEMORY_EMPTY` emitter lands in milestone 8 (`aidlc-runtime.ts compile`). The §13 Learnings Ritual writes a per-stage memory.md during execution; on stage approval, the runtime-graph compile reads memory.md and emits `MEMORY_EMPTY` for any stage with zero non-blank entries under the four standard headings. milestone 12's learning-gate tool (`aidlc-learnings.ts persist`) emits `RULE_LEARNED` when a kept learning lands as a dated practice entry in `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{project,team}.md`, and `SENSOR_PROPOSED` when a learning installs a sensor binding (manifest + originating stage `sensors:` frontmatter). Doctor reads these rows for diary-discipline observability.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_EMPTY` | `tools/aidlc-runtime.ts` | Stage approval's runtime-graph compile found memory.md missing or with zero non-blank entries under §13's four headings |
| `RULE_LEARNED` | `tools/aidlc-learnings.ts` | The learning gate persisted a kept learning as a dated practice entry to `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/{project,team}.md` |
| `SENSOR_PROPOSED` | `tools/aidlc-learnings.ts` | The learning gate scaffolded a project-tier sensor manifest and bound it to the originating stage's `sensors:` frontmatter |

### Swarm

The swarm taxonomy has seven events. Six emit from the stateless referee `aidlc-swarm.ts`: `prepare` captures the exact stage-attempt token, stamps it into worktree creation metadata, and forks the batch; `finalize` requires that token to remain current, re-verifies every claimed Unit, snapshots its exact declared record artifacts plus bound source manifest, merges those records and AIDLC metadata, and emits convergence/failure, baton, and batch rows. `SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` emits later from `aidlc-worktree.ts merge`, after the immutable reviewed application source lands in main. It correlates durable worktree provenance with the exact current Bolt, batch, stage, and run floor, then links the main checkout from the stage baseline, the prior attempt's accepted rejection fingerprint, or the previous current-attempt aggregate. Selector-free merges recover the creating intent from durable creation authority; explicit mismatches name the required `--space`/`--intent` recovery, and authority-path comparison canonicalizes filesystem aliases. Pre-binding fieldless convergence retains historical branch-merge behavior; modern convergence does not advance routing until its source-merge authority exists. The `check` subcommand remains advisory and emits nothing. The conductor handles `invoke-swarm` as an orthogonal directive kind beside the stage `mode` enum; it does not activate the reserved `agent-team` mode.

| Event | Emitter | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `SWARM_STARTED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | Swarm referee `prepare` captured the exact attempt, the full attempt-bound Unit obligation set, and forked one batch of dependency-linked Units |
| `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | A swarm Unit re-verified green and untampered, copied its exact declared record artifacts plus bound `source-manifest.json` into the main record, and merged its AIDLC metadata back. Unless the row explicitly carries `Source Freshness Bypass: true`, finalize also verified the configured post-Bolt reviewer receipt, current `Source Fingerprint` and `Unit Source Fingerprint`, and the attested raw-aware base-to-worktree footprint against reviewed manifest claims before recording the immutable `Source Commit`. A bypass row omits those freshness guarantees and requires `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` again at source merge. |
| `SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` | The exact current-attempt immutable reviewed source landed in the creating repository and extended the aggregate source fingerprint chain. The row carries that immutable `Source Commit` plus the portable `Repo` selector; settled completion requires it to match the Unit's latest convergence, requires one row per converged Unit, and verifies the final main checkout. |
| `SWARM_UNIT_FAILED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | A swarm Unit failed the `finalize` re-verify (not claimed, claimed-but-red, tampered, or missing its configured reviewer receipt) |
| `SWARM_BATON_RETURNED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | A swarm Unit returned the baton to the conductor for orchestrator-mediated coordination |
| `SWARM_COMPLETED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | All Units in the batch finished (converged or failed); batch closed |
| `SWARM_DEGRADED` | `tools/aidlc-swarm.ts` | `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` was requested but the Workflow tool was unavailable; the conductor ran the subagent floor |

Every event in the taxonomy is either backed by a real emitter or marked `Reserved (v0.4.0 PR N)` / `Reserved (v0.5.0 PR N)` / `Reserved (v0.6.0 PR N)` for a pre-registered upcoming consumer. The drift test enforces both halves — the `Reserved` early-skip applies only while the cell literally contains "Reserved"; consumer PRs replace it with the real emitter file path in the same commit they ship the emit call.

## Audit-first atomicity

State-mutating commands emit their audit entries **before** mutating the state file — with two documented exceptions: the audit-of-intent group below (audit first, side-effect second, for outcomes that cannot be checked before emission) and the DocumentKB catalog events (audit **last** — see "Audit-last for derived catalogs"). Two consequences:

1. If audit emission fails (lock timeout, disk error, invalid event type), the tool throws before touching state. The state stays at its previous value; audit.md stays clean.
2. If state writing fails *after* audit emission, the audit has an "intent" entry but the state didn't move. The drift is visible and diagnosable; `--doctor` surfaces it.

The case `test("65: approve is audit-first ...")` in `tests/unit/t17.test.ts` proves this for `approve`: chmod'ing audit.md to read-only forces an audit failure and asserts the state file stays at `[?]` (not `[x]`). The same invariant holds for `gate-start`, `reject`, `revise`, `skip`, `advance`, `complete-workflow`, `reuse-artifact`, `aidlc-bolt.ts set-autonomy`, and `aidlc-state.ts fork` / `aidlc-state.ts merge` (the v0.4.0 milestone 9 state fork/merge subcommands — see `tests/unit/t76.test.ts` for the equivalent chmod-the-lock-dir Part A and chmod-the-target-after-emit Part B proofs).

State fork/merge are deliberately NOT in the audit-of-intent exception below: re-reading and re-writing a state file is idempotent (unlike `git worktree add`, which leaves the worktree present after a kill-9 between emit and git), so the strict invariant applies cleanly. A failed state write after a successful audit emit becomes a phantom `STATE_FORKED` row that doctor (v0.4.0 milestone 15) reconciles against the worktree's record-dir `aidlc-state.md` existence.

### Audit-last for derived catalogs (`DOCUMENT_INDEXED`, `DOCUMENT_UPDATED`, `DOCUMENT_REMOVED`)

The DocumentKB events invert the ordering: `aidlc-knowledge.ts` collects them during a commit and emits them **only after** `index.json`, every `metadata.json`, and every `content.md` write has succeeded. This is the one place in the framework where audit follows state, and it is a deliberate consequence of the catalog being **derived**.

Workflow state is authoritative — nothing can rebuild `aidlc-state.md`, so an audit row recorded ahead of a failed write leaves a phantom entry that `--doctor` can reconcile against the state file, and that diagnosable drift is the better trade. The DocumentKB catalog is the opposite: it is reconstructible from disk, because `sync` rebuilds a lost `index.json` from the surviving per-document `metadata.json` records, tombstones included. So the two failure modes are not symmetric here:

- **Audit before state** (rejected): a `DOCUMENT_UPDATED` row asserting a revision the catalog never took. Every later reader of the ledger — `--doctor`, an export, an agent citing provenance — is misled by a change that did not happen, and no rebuild removes the false row.
- **Audit after state** (chosen): a committed catalog change with no ledger row. The catalog itself remains authoritative; an idempotent retry rewrites any missing derived metadata and emits a repair row that describes the already-committed source/digest/scope. The missing row is therefore recoverable without inventing a state transition that did not occur.

A missing entry understates what happened; a phantom entry asserts something untrue. For a derived artifact that can be rebuilt, understating is the safer failure. The same reasoning does not extend to any authoritative state file, which is why this exception is scoped to these three events and not generalised.

### Audit-of-intent semantics (`WORKTREE_*`, `AUDIT_*`, and merge-dispatch `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED`)

Audit-of-intent semantics apply to side-effects whose outcome cannot be checked before emission — including disk operations (worktree creation / removal, audit byte-copy) and LLM Task dispatch (aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent). The emitting tool writes the audit entry first, then performs the side-effect. If the side-effect fails after the emit, the tool calls `emitError` with the slug embedded in the message (`[slug=<slug>]`); the audit-fork / audit-merge handlers additionally tag failures with `[fork-emitted:<timestamp>]` so `--doctor` (v0.4.0 milestone 15) can distinguish "intent recorded, side-effect never landed" from earlier failure modes. For `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED`, doctor reconciliation matches orphan INVOKED rows to a missing `MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` or `MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` partner via slug + timestamp window (no correlation tag needed because the LLM Task call has no disk artifact to sequence against). `appendAuditEntry` records an `ERROR_LOGGED` entry on disk-side-effect failure; doctor reconciles audit drift at observation time.

| Event group | Emitter | Side-effect that follows the emit |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKTREE_CREATED`, `WORKTREE_MERGED`, `WORKTREE_DISCARDED` | `tools/aidlc-worktree.ts` | `git worktree add`, `git merge` + cleanup, `git worktree remove` + branch delete |
| `AUDIT_FORKED`, `AUDIT_MERGED` | `tools/aidlc-audit.ts` | `mkdir -p` + `copyFileSync` of main audit; `appendFileSync` of worktree-audit delta to main audit |
| `MERGE_DISPATCH_INVOKED` | `tools/aidlc-bolt.ts` `dispatch-event` | `Task(aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, ...)` LLM dispatch — the side-effect is the LLM call itself; success is observed via the matching `MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` or `MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` post-call emit |

This is a deliberate departure from the strict audit-first invariant for stage transitions, motivated by the kill-9 / OS-crash window where neither the rollback emit nor `ERROR_LOGGED` can be guaranteed. The pattern is bounded to the events listed above. `STATE_FORKED` / `STATE_MERGED` (milestone 9) deliberately do NOT take this exception — see the previous section for the strict-first rationale (state writes are idempotent, so a failed write surfaces as recoverable drift instead of unrecoverable orphan state). `MERGE_DISPATCH_RETURNED` / `MERGE_DISPATCH_FALLBACK` are post-call emits (audit-of-result, not intent — strict-first) and don't take the exception. All other state-mutating commands stay strict-first per the section above.

`SWARM_SOURCE_MERGED` is post-result authority, not an audit-of-intent row. If the Git merge commit lands but this row cannot be appended, the tool preserves the worktree and returns `[merge-succeeded:<sha>]` with a non-retryable remedy. Rerunning would merge source twice and is forbidden; restart the stage attempt, or use `AIDLC_SKIP_SOURCE_FRESHNESS=1` only after explicit human approval. If the row did land and only later cleanup failed, rerunning the same `aidlc-worktree merge` detects that authority and performs cleanup only; it never reapplies source or emits a second authority row.

### Authority invariants

Two rules govern every artifact the engine reads as authorization: Plan Approval
challenges, responses and receipts, reviewer receipts, gate and Unit lifecycle
receipts, and the active-directive marker.

**A query never writes, and a guard never deletes evidence.** `next`, the Stop
hook's `next` probe, the `unit start` route check, `/aidlc --status`, `--doctor`
and `team-board` are queries. The two engine observers (the Stop probe and the
route check) write nothing at all, and a typed barrier at the durable write
primitives makes an observer that reaches one fail loudly rather than corrupt
authority. A guard's only move is to refuse: it does not clear a receipt, a
challenge, or a marker to express a refusal. Only an explicit human decision
(Request Changes) withdraws a recorded decision, and only the owning tool retires
one.

**Authority binds to content and attempt, never to issuance identity or event
order.** A receipt is valid when its target, its content fingerprint, and its
stage attempt match the live state. It does not matter which directive presented
the question, how many times that directive was re-issued, what revision the
marker was on, or which audit shard was written first. Two counter-examples this
chapter used to describe, both removed: rotating an authority epoch when a
directive was re-issued, so re-asking the engine what to do invalidated an
approval nobody had changed; and clearing the Plan Approval runtime directory
from a publication path, so a query destroyed the evidence it came to read.

A field the engine ignores when comparing state is a deliberate classification,
not an oversight: see the cache-layer projection the active directive binds to,
and the contributor question in
[`11-contributing.md`](11-contributing.md#authority-policy).

### Guard admission and recovery asks

A guard that refuses returns a typed refusal, not a sentence the conductor has to
interpret: the code, the blocked action, the invariant it protects, one sentence
for the human, and the remedies that are executable from the current lifecycle
state (`in-progress`, `awaiting-approval`, `revising`, `completed`, `pending`,
`skipped`; for a team Unit, the Unit's own gate status). Every remedy carries a
closed `op` from `GUARD_REMEDY_OPS` in `aidlc-lib.ts` (`present-approval-gate`,
`request-review`, `start-recovery-review`, `apply-repairs-then-request`,
`record-verdict`, `retry-pending`, `request-changes`, `redo-jump`,
`restore-or-jump`, `restart-stage`, `change-scope`, `restore-scope`,
`abort-bolt`, `repair-source-boundary`, `reconfirm-summary`,
`unset-unattended`). Routing decisions compare `op` and never the remedy
sentence; the directive contract refuses an unknown `op`.

**One predicate per guard, shared.** The chain of guards for a lifecycle action
is listed once (`admitStageAction` in `aidlc-state.ts`) and called by both the
enforcing handler and the router: `report` and `next` run it on the same state
snapshot before spawning the state tool, so the router and the tool cannot
disagree about a refusal. The attempt as a guard sees it (budget, the single
recovery slot, the pending review, and whether summary, review, and source
evidence still cover the current bytes) is built in one place,
`guardAttemptState`, from the shared attempt reducer.

**One rule for first occurrence, at both sites.** A refusal renders as a
guard-recovery `ask` the first time it happens. The router emits it as the
directive; an enforcing tool prints the human sentence and then the same ask as
the last line of its refusal, which the router parses back into the directive it
would have emitted itself. The `.aidlc-guard-refusals/` record beside the other
gitignored runtime files counts repetitions of one guard state (stage, Unit,
lifecycle state, attempt fields, the latest session/workflow/jump/rejection
boundary, and the resource fingerprints); it carries no authority, and an
observer reads it without writing. A refusal with no executable remedy is still a
question: a terminal ask with an empty remedy list that names the situation, and
past the repetition cap the guard-state signature for escalation. Nothing here
ever emits an `error` directive or counts silently.

**The human's selection survives the re-ask.** A guard-recovery ask is published
as an active-directive marker (`kind: "ask"`, `ask_type: "guard-recovery"`). The
marker carries `remedies`, the offered `op`/`action` entries in display order. The
human-turn hook records the human's remedy selection on it (`delivery: consumed`,
`guard_recovery_response.status: awaiting-feedback`) together with the response's
`selection_sha256` and `selected_op`; `selected_op` is null when the selection is
unmatched or ambiguous. Their later feedback changes the response to `status:
ready`. A repeated `next` that derives the same ask for an unchanged state, gate,
and ordered remedy `op`/`action` entries returns the ask without rewriting the
marker, and the Stop hook releases the turn on the ask, so the conductor is never
told to re-present a question the human already answered. `reject` is allowed only
after `selected_op` records `request-changes` and matching human feedback arrives:
`--feedback` must be that human's own words, compared whitespace-normalized. A
paraphrase is refused, and a selection alone is refused with "ask what should
change". Legacy consumed responses without `selected_op` are refused rather than
treated as authorization.
The ask names the blocked target, so it may carry a Unit; the reject
names the gate the report path allows, which is `--unit <name>` under Unit
Ownership: team and the stage alone under solo ownership (where `--unit` is
refused). The binding follows
that same rule: team compares stage and Unit, solo compares the stage. The
gate's "Request Changes" choice is matched tolerant of case, an option prefix,
quotes, and trailing punctuation; Plan Approval keeps its exact labels because
those are the anti-forgery binding.


### Forbidden patterns

Don't emit audit events from LLM prose. The following anti-patterns are the reason this refactor exists:

- `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-audit.ts append WORKFLOW_STARTED ...` as a step in SKILL.md — replaced by the tool emitting it internally
- `**Event**: STAGE_COMPLETED` markdown block written by a stage file — events only come from `appendAuditEntry` in a tool or hook
- Freeform `## Artifact Update` sections written by hooks — replaced by canonical `ARTIFACT_CREATED` / `ARTIFACT_UPDATED`

The public CLI enforces the sharpest slice of this mechanically: `append` / `append-batch` refuse the authority-bearing receipts the engine's guards read as authorization evidence (`STAGE_COMPLETED`, `HUMAN_TURN`, `GATE_APPROVED`, `GATE_REJECTED`, `QUESTION_ANSWERED`, `PLAN_APPROVAL_RECORDED`, `REVIEW_REQUESTED`, `REVIEW_COMPLETED`, `PIPELINE_LINK_COMPLETED`, `ARTIFACT_REUSED`, `SWARM_STARTED`, `SWARM_UNIT_CONVERGED`, `AUTONOMY_MODE_SET`, `UNIT_OWNERSHIP_SET`, `UNIT_GATE_RHYTHM_SET`, `UNIT_STARTED`, `UNIT_PAUSED`, `UNIT_RESUMED`, `UNIT_COMPLETED`, `UNIT_MERGED`, and the three `DOCUMENT_*` provenance events — the `CLI_PROTECTED_EVENT_TYPES` set in `aidlc-audit.ts`), every field name must match a strict printable single-line label grammar (and `Event` remains reserved), values have line terminators escaped, and `append-raw` refuses taxonomy event lines or line-breaking headings. The structured renderer exclusively owns `Timestamp` and `Event`, so every block it writes contains exactly one of each; free-form `append-raw` blocks sit outside that guarantee (they carry the emitter's `**Timestamp**:` line, no `**Event**:` line, and a verbatim body). `Timestamp` remains accepted by generic `--field` parsing for compatibility, but a supplied value is intentionally ignored; park/unpark and other owning tools do not pass it. Historical shards are not rewritten: block-aware readers need no migration, while flat readers must split on `---` and use the first emitter-owned timestamp in each block or deduplicate older duplicate timestamp fields. Owning tools and hooks emit through the library import (`appendAuditEntry`), which the floor does not touch. Test fixtures that simulate owning emitters set `AIDLC_ALLOW_DIRECT_AUDIT_EVENTS=1`.

The drift test at `tests/integration/t48-audit-event-emitters.test.ts` catches drift between this chapter's tables and the code: every event in the tables must have a matching `appendAuditEntry(..., "EVENT", ...)` call in the declared emitter file, and every emission call site in the codebase must appear in the tables. The test also guards against deleted events being resurrected and against pairing invariants (e.g., `handleApprove` must emit both `GATE_APPROVED` and `STAGE_COMPLETED`).

---

## Same-commit rule

When you change state-machine behavior, update both the code and this chapter in the **same commit**. The rule catches itself via the drift test, but the cost of fixing drift after the fact (chasing down who owns which event across three files) is much higher than updating one table.

Specifically:
- Adding an event → add to `VALID_EVENT_TYPES` in `aidlc-audit.ts`, add the emitter, add to the appropriate table above.
- Deleting an event → remove from `VALID_EVENT_TYPES`, remove emitter, remove the row here, grep the codebase for any stale prose or tests.
- Renaming an emitter file → update the Emitter column in every table row that points at it.
- Adding an input to a fingerprint, an epoch, or a receipt identity → name the human-visible change that input detects, in the table row here and in the Authority Policy checklist in [`11-contributing.md`](11-contributing.md#authority-policy). An input no human action changes does not belong in an identity.

## Known limitations

- **Multi-project sessions.** Claude Code doesn't fire a hook on `cd` within a session, so if a user runs `/aidlc` in project A and then `cd`s to project B, the session hooks won't re-fire against B's audit.md. Session events may not perfectly reflect every workspace switch. This is a Claude Code limitation, not an AI-DLC design flaw.

## Stage result validity projection

A completed checkbox records execution history. It does not prove that the
result still matches the runtime artifact instances captured at completion.
Execution state and result validity are therefore separate concepts.

Each main-workflow `STAGE_COMPLETED` event may carry a schema-3 `Validation
Basis`. Runtime resolution remains concrete and instance-aware: the active Bolt
DAG expands per-unit artifacts, `produces_kinds` filters unit kinds, and the
artifact-vocabulary filename mapping resolves collision-safe names such as
`build-test-results` -> `test-results.md`.

The audit receipt remains compact because the current projection is stage-level,
not Unit-level. For each receipt-recorded canonical artifact it records the producer,
required flag, instance/present counts, a structure hash over resolved
path/unit/kind tuples, and a content hash over the corresponding file states.

Before normal `next` routing, the orchestrator recomputes each tracked basis.
A mismatch projects the completed stage as `stale`. Downstream propagation uses
artifact inputs actually recorded by completed consumers, not every possible
static optional `consumes` declaration. A missing optional input therefore
creates no edge; if it later appears, the consumer's own aggregate basis changes
and becomes stale.

The basis is captured when `STAGE_COMPLETED` is reported. It does not prove
which bytes the stage read while executing. "Observed dependency" means an
input recorded in the completion receipt; changes before capture become the
baseline, while later changes can be detected.

Schema-2 and earlier receipts remain untracked until normal re-completion.
Schema 2 cannot distinguish its former zero-instance resolution from the
stage-level zero-Unit resolution, so treating it as advisory avoids reporting
unchanged in-flight workflows as stale after an upgrade.

`requires_stage` is not treated as an invalidation edge because the current v2
schema uses it for both semantic dependency and ordering. An explicit edge kind
would be required before it can safely participate in validity propagation.

The projection remains read-only and advisory. `next` keeps its normal
directive kind and adds a machine-readable `stage_validity` field for stale,
revalidation, or unavailable results. Untracked-only histories appear in
`/aidlc --status` rather than every `next`.
The suggested recovery is `/aidlc --stage <earliest-affected-stage>`, but this
release does not enforce it. Schema-1, receipt-less, and capture-failed
histories remain untracked/fail-open until a normal re-completion writes schema
2. The scope is AI-DLC Markdown artifact validity;
source-code, Git-tree, CI, deployment, and external-system validity require
separate ownership and observation contracts.

Receipt lookup starts at the latest `WORKFLOW_STARTED` event in the selected
intent audit. Historical ledgers from releases that supported forced re-init
may contain a new boundary from a forced re-init in those releases; completions
before that boundary read as untracked and fail open until their stages
complete again.

Artifact resolution follows the approved workflow plan for per-Unit stages.
When Units Generation is skipped, including express and recomposed zero-Unit
plans, validity resolves one stage-level artifact instance under
`<record>/construction/<stage>/` and does not inspect a Bolt DAG or stale
per-Unit directories. When Units Generation executes, normal Bolt DAG expansion
and the legacy no-DAG directory fallback remain unchanged. Missing or ambiguous
plan state makes receipt capture or inspection unavailable with a non-blocking
warning rather than reporting false drift.
