# Kiro IDE hook payload — empirical reference

How Kiro IDE delivers context to a command hook, captured live on 0.12-main
(probe `.kiro.hook` files that dumped stdin, argv, and the full environment),
1.0.165 (probe v2 hook JSON files; upstream #543/#555), and 1.0.242
(UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse probes on Windows). This is the evidence base
for the `harness/kiro-ide/` adapter; the CLI harness (`harness/kiro/`) uses a
different, kiro-cli-shaped stdin mechanism.

The redacted native Windows before/after captures are retained in
[`research/kiro-windows-output-encoding/`](research/kiro-windows-output-encoding/).

## The channel changed across IDE generations

| | Kiro IDE 0.12 | Kiro IDE 1.x (≥1.0.1xx) |
|---|---|---|
| Hook registration | `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` (`{"version":"1.0.0","when":{...},"then":{...}}`) | `.kiro/hooks/*.json` v2 schema (`{"version":"v1","hooks":[{name,trigger,matcher,action}]}`, PascalCase triggers). Legacy `.kiro.hook` files are **silently inert** — never executed. |
| Context channel | `USER_PROMPT` env var (JSON string) | **stdin** (JSON, written and closed). `USER_PROMPT` arrives empty. |
| stdin behavior | Opened but NEVER written/closed — a bare read hangs | Written and closed — a read resolves promptly |
| Field naming | camelCase: `{ toolName, toolArgs, toolResult, toolSuccess }` | snake_case: `{ session_id, hook_event_name, cwd, tool_name, tool_input, tool_response }` — **no success flag** |

A live 1.0.165 PostToolUse capture, field-verbatim:

```json
{"session_id":"sess_…","hook_event_name":"PostToolUse","cwd":"/path/to/project","tool_name":"execute_bash","tool_input":{},"tool_response":"Output:\n…\nExit Code: 0"}
```

The adapter uses a non-empty `USER_PROMPT` immediately (the 0.12 channel,
whose stdin never closes). When that variable is empty, it reads stdin for the
1.x channel, raced against a broken-channel timeout. The production default is
2s; a positive `AIDLC_IDE_STDIN_TIMEOUT_MS` value overrides the ceiling in
milliseconds for diagnostics and deterministic latency tests. Both field
spellings are accepted. Acquisition is gated to the payload-dependent targets,
including `plan-approval-guard`, the two terminal-command targets, plus
`session-start` and `continue-workflow` for their modern `session_id`, and
`record-human-turn` for the exact approval response. Every other target
(including the per-tool-call approval floor) touches neither channel and keeps
its zero-latency path.

The legacy environment variable name does not imply raw user text: the measured
0.12 contract is camelCase JSON. A promptSubmit payload without a `prompt`
field therefore advances only the legacy turn clock; the terminal utility is
recognized later from `toolArgs.command` on the matching preToolUse event. Raw
`/aidlc ...` text remains accepted for newer Kiro generations that expose it
directly, but is not the 0.12 compatibility claim.

`VSCODE_IPC_HOOK` / `VSCODE_PID` are also present in the IDE (absent on the
CLI). Legacy Plan Approval hashes those measured host-instance values into its
runtime session identity, so two IDE windows in one workspace do not share
challenge/response files. Other adapter routing still keys off the payload
channels above.

## Per-event captures

Result prose is identical on both channels (`toolResult` on 0.12,
`tool_response` on 1.x):

| Event | tool name | tool inputs | result prose | recoverable? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| UserPromptSubmit (1.0.242) | n/a | `{prompt:""}` | n/a | prompt: no; session id: yes |
| PreToolUse (shell, 1.0.242) | `execute_pwsh` | `{command,cwd,run_in_background,timeout}` | n/a | command: yes |
| PostToolUse (write) — create | `fs_write` | `{}` (empty) | `Created the <PATH> file.` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (write) — edit | `str_replace` | `{}` (empty) | `Replaced text in <PATH>` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (write) — append | `fs_append` | `{}` (empty) | `Appended the text to the <PATH> file.` | path: from the result prose only |
| PostToolUse (shell) | `execute_bash` | `{}` (empty) | `Output:\n<stdout>\n\nExit Code: 0` | command: **not** recoverable (only stdout) |

### Critical limitations

1. **PostToolUse write/shell captures have empty tool inputs** on both
   channels. Their written path must therefore be parsed from the result prose,
   and the shell command is absent (only stdout + exit code is present). This is
   not a universal IDE rule, and delivery is not uniform across generations:
   later 1.x builds populate some PreToolUse and delegation inputs (#543).
   Issue #763 reports that Kiro IDE 1.0.309 populated PreToolUse subagent
   dispatch with `prompt` and `explanation`, shell/write matchers with
   `command`, `cwd`, `run_in_background`, and `timeout`, and PostToolUse inputs
   as well. That 1.0.309 observation was reported, not measured in this
   repository; the measured base is the 0.12, 1.0.165, and 1.0.242 captures
   described above.
2. **1.x carries no success flag.** Only the 0.12 channel's explicit boolean
   `toolSuccess: false` drops a well-formed write from the audit (#417); a 1.x
   payload with the field absent falls through to the path check. Because that
   channel cannot report failure structurally, a failed write on 1.x arrives
   only as error prose — so the adapter classifies before logging: prose
   RECOGNISED as a failure is sent to `hookDebug` (written only when hook
   debugging is enabled); there is no artifact to audit, so not forwarding it
   is correct, not decay. An unrecognised wording still records a visible
   hook-drop, which is the case that signals real degradation. On the legacy
   0.12 channel, explicit `toolSuccess: true` remains authoritative and bypasses
   failure-prose inference. A present non-null payload field with the wrong
   runtime type is treated as malformed:
   the advisory hook exits successfully, records a visible drop, and forwards no audit or subagent event. `null` is treated like
   an unavailable field, matching the channel's existing absent-value contract.
3. **Paths in the result prose are workspace-RELATIVE**, but the core hooks
   compare against an absolute record root — so the adapter resolves them to
   absolute before forwarding.

## Consequences for each hook

- **write-audit-log / run-sensors** — recoverable: scrape the file path from
  the result prose, resolve to absolute, feed the core hooks the Claude-shaped
  `{tool_input:{file_path}}`. When no path can be extracted the adapter splits
  two cases rather than logging both: prose recognised as a **failed** write is
  sent to `hookDebug` (written only when hook debugging is enabled) and is not
  forwarded because no artifact exists; this inference runs only when the
  payload has no structured success flag. Explicit `toolSuccess: true` and any
  other unmatched wording record a visible hook-drop (never a silent no-op) —
  that is the invisible-decay case the drop log exists to surface. Conflating
  them made `--doctor` report degradation on healthy workspaces.
- **rebuild-stage-graph** — the shell command is unrecoverable, so the IDE path
  drops the command filter and gates purely on the audit tail (with an mtime
  idempotency guard so a lingering transition — e.g. after `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`
  — does not recompile on every subsequent shell command). The shell result and
  session identity are still forwarded: modern events use their exact
  `session_id`, while the legacy channel uses the host-derived identity retained
  by SessionStart. When the result names a successful `intent-create`, the shared
  hook binds that session to the created record.
- **sync-workflow-state** — the IDE gives no task payload, so it derives the current
  stage from the latest `STAGE_STARTED` in the audit tail. This is a
  **forward-only** mirror: it never rewinds `Current Stage` to a completed or
  skipped stage, and never fires when the workflow is not `Running` (guards
  against resurrecting a finished workflow). Matched to `execute_bash` — the
  IDE surfaces no task event the sync could parse.
- **log-subagent** — payload-dependent. IDE 0.12 sent `invoke_sub_agent`; 1.x
  (1.0.89-1.0.138) sent `subagent_<agent>` instead, each preceded by an empty
  `subagent_response` shell (`"Response recorded."`). The registration matcher
  is therefore broad (`^(subagent_.+|invoke_sub_agent)$`) so every delegate name
  reaches the adapter, and the adapter drops `subagent_response` — that shell
  carries prose but no identity, so forwarding it would fabricate a
  `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` row with `Agent Type: unknown`. Identity prefers the
  structured 1.x `subagent_<agent>` tool name (#543) — it is platform-provided,
  so agent-authored result prose cannot misattribute the audit row — and falls
  back to the `**Reviewer:**` / `**Agent:**` result marker from #459, which is
  the only identity signal on the 0.12 `invoke_sub_agent` shape.
- **plan-approval-guard** — populated PreToolUse arguments are forwarded to the
  shared target-aware guard. Kiro IDE 0.12 identifies the tool but supplies an
  empty argument object, so the adapter uses a mediated planned-source protocol:
  only the measured `fs_write` and `str_replace` tools remain available while
  planning; shell, append, delete, patch, aliases, and custom mutation tools stop
  before approval. After a canonical plan write the adapter injects the current
  Testing Contract. After a canonical questions write it replaces the
  target-bound `[Approval Fingerprint]`, records the live workspace source as
  `[Planned Source]` (the legacy channel cannot run the fingerprint command, so
  the adapter owns both tags; `unbindable` when the workspace has no source
  fingerprint), and invokes the reserved decision or answer tool itself. Kiro
  discards PostToolUse stdout, so a successful write hook remains silent; when
  the decision or answer step is refused, the hook exits 2 with the refusal on
  stderr instead of dropping it, because the write window stays latched until
  the human recovers. Workspace source is checked against the recorded
  `[Planned Source]` exactly as the answer path checks it: before a planned
  source is recorded there is nothing to compare, and once one is recorded a
  drift blocks opaque tools with the remedy "re-present the plan" while the
  canonical planning writes stay open so that remedy can be executed.
  The invoking `next` or final steering `continue` carries one
  `legacy_plan_approval_choices` capability in its Code Generation directive.
  Runtime stores only its hashes, while the plaintext labels remain in that
  chat's tool result. The human's later `promptSubmit` must carry one exact
  label; unrelated prompts receive no capability. Ownership is global for the
  active intent/revision rather than looked up through the incoming session.
  Recovery is human-gated: the owning window first receives a typed recovery
  ask and must record the exact `Recover Plan Approval` response before a later
  `next` rotates any offer or challenge. Another live window is refused. A
  replacement window can request the same human recovery only after the
  recorded owner PID is gone, or after an IPC-only owner's endpoint disappears.
  Takeover rotates any pending challenge and clears its prior response. The
  shared questions file stays canonical and the audit redacts the choices.
  Missing or corrupt offer/challenge files do not make authority disappear:
  the pre-write window itself is an orphan-recovery latch if PostToolUse never
  arrives, and a matching write violation continues that latch when PostToolUse
  does run. Fresh publication remains blocked until the exact human recovery
  response. The adapter preserves a recovery ask and, after success, clears only
  the violation/write window rather than deleting the replacement offer. Before each
  write, a latch is created; authoritative `toolSuccess: false` and recognized
  failure prose clear it because no mutation occurred, while unknown outcomes
  retain it and require recovery.
  argument-less planning write the adapter stores the current target/revision in
  a protected write window. If the write deletes or corrupts state, the active
  marker, or another authority file, PostToolUse poisons the saved revision and
  later mutation calls remain blocked even when live authority can no longer be
  parsed. Adapter-owned `next` recovery clears that poison only after the engine
  returns a valid non-error directive. Raw audit appends have no authority.
  A new stage attempt retires the approval; a fresh directive for the same target
  and attempt does not. Generation start re-baselines the source the plan is bound
  to, and refuses rather than deletes if the workspace source moved first.
- **session-start** — reads the modern `session_id` and persists it under the
  gitignored runtime session directory; the legacy channel derives a stable
  per-host-instance ID from `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK`/`VSCODE_PID`.
- **terminal commands** — newer builds that expose the submitted `/aidlc ...`
  prompt run deterministic utilities at UserPromptSubmit. IDE 1.0.242 exposes
  an empty prompt, so the fallback recognizes the exact `execute_pwsh`
  `aidlc-orchestrate.ts next` call at PreToolUse, runs the classified utility
  once, and refuses the duplicate shell call. Both routes decode UTF-8
  explicitly and remove terminal protocol/control bytes only from the
  plain-text relay; structured hook JSON and unrelated refusal paths are not
  rewritten. Modern turn/latch state is keyed by a hash of `session_id`, so
  concurrent chats cannot reuse one another's output; payloads without a
  session identity use one explicit legacy bucket. The 0.12 camelCase fallback
  reads the command from `toolArgs.command`.
- **stop** — reads the modern Stop event's `session_id` and prefers it over the
  workspace-global SessionStart marker, so concurrent chats consume only their
  own post-create handoff receipts. Legacy agentStop and broken modern channels
  fall back to the retained identity.
- **record-human-turn** — reads the modern `session_id` and answer payload, or
  the legacy `USER_PROMPT`; it can submit an exact directive-issued choice but
  never reveals, rotates, or transfers another chat's protected capability.
- **session-end / block** — need no payload and never read stdin. Session-end
  reuses the identity persisted by SessionStart, with the legacy lifecycle
  fallback retained only where no approval authority is involved.

## toolResult path-extraction patterns

| toolName | wording | canonical tool |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `fs_write` | `Created the <PATH> file.` | Write |
| `str_replace` | `Replaced text in <PATH>` (may carry a trailing ` (N occurrences)`) | Edit |
| `fs_append` | `Appended the text to the <PATH> file.` | Edit |

The extractor trims trailing whitespace/newlines before matching and strips a
trailing parenthetical from the `str_replace` form. `fs_write` maps to `Write`;
`str_replace`/`fs_append` map to `Edit` (both target an existing file → the core
write-audit-log records `ARTIFACT_UPDATED`).
