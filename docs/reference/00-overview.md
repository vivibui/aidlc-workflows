# Developer Reference Overview

> Part of the [AI-DLC documentation](../README.md) · [User Guide](../guide/00-introduction.md) · [Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md) · **Developer Reference**

This reference documents the internal architecture and implementation of AI-DLC. It is intended for contributors changing the AI-DLC codebase itself -- the orchestrator, hooks, CLI tools, the stage-graph compile pipeline, the audit taxonomy, or the test suite.

If you are **using** AI-DLC to build software, start with the [User Guide](../guide/00-introduction.md). If you are **reshaping how AI-DLC behaves** through configuration -- adding a stage or an agent, defining a scope, authoring rules and sensors, adding team knowledge -- start with the [Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md); those are data changes, not code changes, and the chapters there narrate the workflow before pointing back here for the exhaustive schema.

> **Paths in this reference.** AI-DLC is authored once and generated per harness, so a file is named by one of four conventions, by intent:
> - **`core/…`** -- the hand-authored, harness-neutral **source of truth** (e.g. `core/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts`, `core/aidlc-common/stages/`). This is where you edit. When a path names where a file is *authored* or *changed*, it is a `core/` path.
> - **`dist/<harness>/…`** -- an **ignored local generated** source/development projection (`dist/claude/.claude/`, `dist/kiro/.kiro/`, `dist/kiro-ide/.kiro/`, `dist/codex/`, `dist/opencode/`, `dist/copilot/`). Never hand-edited or committed; materialized by `bun scripts/package.ts`. Release payloads use `runtime/<harness>/` inside `aidlc-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
> - **`<harness-dir>/…`** (e.g. `.claude/`, `.kiro/`, `.codex/`) -- the **runtime** location inside an *installed* project, where commands run and the framework reads/writes during a workflow (`{{INVOKE}} engine graph compile`, `loadAgents()` reading `.claude/agents/`). The directory is a parameter of the harness.
>
> Where this reference shows a bare `.claude/` path, read it as the runtime location for the Claude harness specifically; the same file is authored in `core/` and ships to each harness's own directory.

## How to Navigate

- **Where does a new concern (rule, methodology, knowledge fact) belong?** Read [Architecture: Configuration layers](01-architecture.md#configuration-layers) — the two-axis model (authorship × consumption) with boundary tests routes any new concern to the correct file.
- **Adding a new stage?** Read [Stage Protocol](04-stage-protocol.md), then the relevant phase file in [Stages](04-stages/), then [Contributing](11-contributing.md).
- **Changing the stage definition format?** Read [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md) before editing any stage `.md` file. Stage file format is data-driven; runtime reads a compiled JSON.
- **Adding or renaming an artifact?** Read [Artifact Vocabulary](16-artifact-vocabulary.md) — the chapter explains the naming rules, the stability policy (rename/removal = major, addition = minor), and points at `aidlc engine graph artifacts` for the live list. The registry is derived from stage files, not written.
- **Adding a new scope?** Read [Contributing: Adding a Scope](11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope). Scopes are file-authored — a `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file plus a `scopes:` tag on each member stage — no TypeScript edits required.
- **Adding a new agent?** Read [Contributing: Adding an Agent](11-contributing.md#adding-an-agent). Agents are data-driven via their `.md` frontmatter — no TypeScript edits required.
- **Modifying an agent?** Read [Agent System](05-agent-system.md) and the agent's file in [Agents](agents/).
- **Working on hooks?** Read [Hooks and Tools](06-hooks-and-tools.md) and [Testing](09-testing.md) for hook test patterns.
- **Changing the orchestrator?** Read [Orchestrator](03-orchestrator.md) and [Architecture](01-architecture.md). If you're adding or modifying audit events, start with the [State Machine](12-state-machine.md) chapter — the drift test will catch you if you don't.

## Relationship to the User Guide

The User Guide (`docs/guide/`) explains **what** AI-DLC does and **how to use it**. This Developer Reference explains **how it works** and **how to change it**. Some topics appear in both:

| Topic | User Guide | Developer Reference |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Agents | What they do, when they appear | Frontmatter contract, how to add/modify |
| Knowledge | How to add company standards | Loading order internals, template system |
| Hooks | What gets logged | Hook implementation, audit event taxonomy |
