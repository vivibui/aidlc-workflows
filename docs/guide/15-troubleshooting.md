# Troubleshooting

This chapter covers common issues and their solutions, organized by symptom.

> **Harness note.** Symptoms and fixes below are written for **Claude Code** (hook
> filenames, `settings.json` blocks, compaction behaviour). The deterministic core
> — state, audit, the engine — behaves identically on every harness, but the
> shell-level surfaces differ: the other harnesses wire hooks and config their own way
> (see [Running on other harnesses](harnesses/README.md)). Where a fix names a
> `.claude/` path or a Claude mechanic, the equivalent lives in your harness's
> config dir.

## Quick Fix Table

| Symptom | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| No audit entries appearing | Run `aidlc doctor`; for a copy install, also verify `bun` is on the hook PATH |
| Claude hooks are restricted by policy | Ask the Claude Code administrator to lift managed `allowManagedHooksOnly`; project settings cannot override it |
| State file corrupted | Run `/aidlc --doctor`, compare against state template |
| Stuck at approval gate | Type your response; use `/aidlc --stage <target>` to jump past it |
| Context compacted mid-session | Run `/aidlc` to resume from checkpoint |
| Audit log too large | Rename to `audit-YYYY-MM.md`; a fresh one is created automatically |
| Hooks appear to hang | Remove stale lock dirs from system temp directory (see below) |
| Statusline shows "ready" | Check `aidlc-state.md` has a `**Lifecycle Phase**` field |
| Statusline not appearing | Run `aidlc doctor`; for a copy install, verify `bun` is on PATH |
| Subagent timed out | Run `/aidlc` to retry or run the stage inline |
| Workflow stuck or misbehaving, need help | Run `/aidlc --doctor --export` and share the produced `.tar.gz` (redacted; no work product) |

---

## Native Install Channel

| Symptom or error | Resolution |
|------------------|------------|
| `Checksum mismatch for <asset>.` or `<asset>: checksum mismatch` | Stop. Do not reuse the downloaded directory. Download the complete release asset set and `checksums.txt` again from the same release. |
| `command not found: aidlc` after `install.sh` | Add the installer-reported bin directory to `PATH` (normally `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`), open a new shell, and run `aidlc doctor`. |
| `--offline requires --from <release-directory>` | Offline mode never falls back to a network release. Transfer the complete release asset set, then pass its directory with `--from` / `-From`; the installer verifies it. |
| `aidlc.cmd` exits 4 or the Windows active pointer is invalid | Do not edit `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\active-executable`. Rerun the same verified installer or use `aidlc use <version>` from a working retained executable. |
| `pending Windows uninstall` or a Windows uninstall recovery failure | Close active AI-DLC commands and run `aidlc doctor`. A valid continuation resumes on the next command; do not delete its temp journal, cleanup script, or machine fence independently. |
| Alpine reports missing `libstdc++.so.6` or `libgcc_s.so.1` | Install the same runtime dependencies required by Bun's and Node.js's musl builds with `apk add libgcc libstdc++`, then rerun the installer or command. Fully static Bun musl compile targets are not available today; the installer reports this remediation but does not install packages. |
| `refusing to refresh while ... workflow(s) are active` | Complete every named workflow, including parked workflows, then rerun `aidlc config`. `--force`, `--yes`, and a plan token cannot bypass this guard. `update` or `use` may proceed because they do not modify projects. |
| `config plan changed after approval` | Rerun `aidlc config --dry-run --json`, review `data.actions`, and apply the new `data.planToken` with exactly the same source and behavior options. |
| `locally modified` or `managed block was locally modified` from `aidlc config` | Run `aidlc config --dry-run --json` and review `data.actions`. Use `--force` only to replace baseline-owned framework bytes or managed blocks; it never authorizes unrelated root content. |
| `unowned whole file` from `aidlc config` | Move or merge the existing file manually before config. Whole-file integrations such as OpenCode's `opencode.json` cannot be claimed with `--force`. |
| `legacy root integration ambiguous; move or delete the unmarked AI-DLC content` | Move or delete the old unmarked AI-DLC block in the named root file, preserve any project-owned text elsewhere, then rerun `aidlc config`. This release intentionally refuses to guess ownership. |
| `managed markers are missing, duplicated, or malformed` | Repair the named root file so it has exactly one matching `BEGIN AI-DLC` / `END AI-DLC` pair, or remove the broken AI-DLC block and rerun `aidlc config`. |
| `project runtime <version> is incompatible with selected engine <version>` | Run `aidlc use <version>` to install and select the compatible version, or refresh the project intentionally with `aidlc config`. |
| `this project requires <version>, which is not installed completely` | Install or reinstall the exact strict-semver pin with `aidlc config --pin <version>`. The dispatcher fails closed instead of falling back to the active machine version; use `aidlc config --unpin` only when the team intends to stop pinning the project. |
| An update was interrupted and `aidlc version` still shows the prior release | This is the safe restored state: the old command remains active. Run `aidlc doctor`, then rerun the same `aidlc update --version <version>` command. |
| `another AI-DLC mutation holds .../.aidlc-transaction.lock` | Let the active init/lifecycle command finish. If its process no longer exists, rerun the command; stale owner-private staging is swept only after the lock is safely reclaimed. |
| `existing aidlc is managed by Homebrew` / `Nix`, or the destination command is `not owned by the AI-DLC installer` | Upgrade through the reported owner. To keep a separate native install, set `AIDLC_BIN_DIR` explicitly to an empty user-owned directory. This release does not itself ship Homebrew or Nix packaging and never replaces a mixed-ownership command. |
| `update cache is invalid` or machine settings are rejected | Run `aidlc system config global list`. Repair or remove only the named `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\aidlc.settings.json` (Windows) or `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/aidlc/aidlc.settings.json` (macOS/Linux); unknown keys and stored credentials are rejected. |
| `HTTPS_PROXY must use HTTP or HTTPS` or a release URL is rejected | Use an HTTP(S) proxy URL and an HTTPS release mirror without credentials, query, or fragment. The native client reads `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`, not `HTTP_PROXY`, and redacts secret-like URL parts in errors. |
| Download fails behind a corporate CA | Pass `--ca-bundle <absolute-path>` or set `AIDLC_CA_BUNDLE`. The Windows bootstrap requires `curl.exe` when a custom CA is supplied. |
| `host inventory unavailable` from a plugin command | Run sync from a host session that injects the current plugin root, or restore the Claude/Codex host registry. Missing or malformed inventory is never treated as proof that content is safe to prune. |
| `cannot prune <plugin>: owned path changed since composition` | Preserve and review the local edit. Reconcile it with the plugin source before retrying; `--yes` does not override ownership hashes. |
| `aidlc system versions prune`, `uninstall`, or plugin prune requires `--yes` | The command is running without an interactive stdin. Review the listed removals, then rerun with `--yes`; integrity refusals cannot be bypassed. |
| `aidlc setup` is unknown, or an npm install is unavailable | Those channels are planned but not shipped. Use the release installer plus `aidlc config`; do not treat proposal transcripts as available commands. |

Native `aidlc doctor` also checks the active command pointer, rollback
eligibility, retained pin completeness, stale pin registrations, abandoned
transaction staging, project version skew, and whether binary-channel host
hooks and permission/trust entries consistently select the native command.

## Hooks Not Firing

**Symptom**: No entries appearing in the intent's `audit/` shards after file writes, or no subagent completion logs.

### Native runtime versus source-generated Bun projection

The source/development `dist/` projection runs its 17 TypeScript hooks through
`bun`. Native installs and versioned release runtimes route those same hooks
through `aidlc`. If a source-generated install cannot find Bun on the
non-interactive PATH, its hooks will not fire.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows
npm install -g bun
# or: powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Verify
bun --version
```

For a source-generated `dist/` install, ensure `bun` is on the PATH inherited by the host, such as
`~/.zshenv` for zsh or `~/.bashrc` for bash and Git Bash, not only an
interactive-shell file. On native Windows PowerShell, the system PATH entry
set by `npm install -g bun` is sufficient.

### Claude managed policy blocks project hooks

If `/hooks` reports that hooks are restricted by policy and shows zero configured hooks, run `/aidlc --doctor`. On Claude Code, doctor reads `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux/WSL, or `%ProgramFiles%\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` followed by the legacy `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` location on Windows. Each candidate also includes alphabetical JSON fragments under its sibling `managed-settings.d/` directory. An effective top-level `allowManagedHooksOnly: true` blocks every project hook declared in `.claude/settings.json`. Set `AIDLC_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH` when the managed file lives elsewhere; its sibling fragment directory is included automatically.

Only the Claude Code administrator can lift this managed setting. After hooks are approved, fully restart the CLI session. Until the policy changes, an attended recovery session can set `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` and `AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD=1` in the environment that launches the CLI; these are temporary bypasses for the receipts that blocked hooks cannot mint.

### Reviewer tool calls refused ("This review cannot open ...")

During a per-unit Construction review, the reviewer-scope hook refuses the dispatched reviewer's tool calls that reach into sibling units' `construction/` paths (the stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a read-scope bound); the refusal names the current unit and directs the reviewer to the supplied files and that unit's own path, and each refusal records a `REVIEWER_SCOPE_BLOCKED` audit row. If your own source tree contains a `construction/` directory unrelated to AI-DLC units (so legitimate reviewer reads are being refused), set `AIDLC_DISABLE_REVIEWER_SCOPE_HOOK=1` to disable enforcement; the prose bound still governs. A reviewer being refused with NO review in flight means a stale dispatch record - check `/aidlc --doctor`'s hook-drop counters (`reviewer-scope.drops`) and delete `<record>/.aidlc-reviewer-dispatch.json` if present (records older than 6 hours are ignored and cleaned automatically).

### Statusline shows a cost segment you don't want (or usage tracking concerns)

On Claude Code, per-stage token usage and cost tracking is on by default: the fold-usage hook records transcript usage into a gitignored local ledger (`aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/usage-ledger.json`), the statusline appends `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>`, and completion audit events carry cost rollups. Nothing is transmitted anywhere (metrics emission is separately opt-in via `AIDLC_METRICS_ENDPOINT`). To turn all local tracking off, set `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1`: the ledger stops updating, the statusline segment disappears, and completion events add no rollup fields. An existing ledger is left on disk; delete it manually if you also want the history gone. Unsetting the flag resumes tracking.

### Hook not configured

Hooks are registered project-wide in the harness's native configuration. On
Claude, verify that `.claude/settings.json` contains the expected `hooks`
events and `statusLine`. For a native project, complete active workflows and
run `aidlc config` to reconcile framework-owned wiring. For a manual copy,
replace the complete harness root from the same versioned
`runtime/<harness>/` archive while preserving project root integrations; do
not patch one hook command in isolation.

### Hooks disabled globally (`disableAllHooks`)

Claude Code honours `"disableAllHooks": true` in any settings layer — enterprise managed settings, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/settings.json`. When set, **every** hook is silently skipped even though the files are present and correctly wired, so the workflow blocks on the first stage (no audit, no state sync, no sensors, no stage-graph rebuild). This is common in regulated environments where IT policy disables hooks via managed settings. `/aidlc --doctor` detects this and fails a **Hooks enabled** row naming the offending layer, following Claude Code's layer precedence so a higher-precedence `false` suppresses a lower `true`.

- If the offending layer is a **project or user file**, remove `"disableAllHooks": true` (or set it to `false` in a higher-precedence layer such as `.claude/settings.local.json`) and restart the session.
- If it is **enterprise managed settings** — the highest-precedence layer — a project or user file cannot override it; IT policy must change it. If policy mandates disabled hooks, AI-DLC v2 is not compatible with that environment: its engine is hook-driven.

The check reads the on-disk managed-settings **file** (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux, `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `%ProgramFiles%\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` on current Windows — `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` is a legacy secondary) plus alphabetical JSON files in the sibling `managed-settings.d/` directory. It does **not** inspect other managed channels Claude Code supports (MDM, Windows registry, or a remote/server-managed source), so a passing row means the resolved value is not `true` in any settings file the check could read, not a guarantee those channels are clean. If your managed file lives at a non-standard path, point the check at it with `AIDLC_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH=/path/to/managed-settings.json`; fragments beside that file are included.

## State File Issues

**Symptom**: Orchestrator reports corrupted state, or workflow behaves unexpectedly.

### State file missing

The state file is created during Initialization or when a scope is provided to `/aidlc`.

- Run `/aidlc --status` to confirm no workflow is active
- Run `/aidlc` or `/aidlc <scope>` to start a fresh workflow

### State file corrupted

The `validate-state.ts` hook checks for two required sections on every compaction: `## Stage Progress` and `## Current Status`. To repair:

1. Run `/aidlc --doctor` and address any reported state, graph, or hook issues
2. If the generated Stage Progress rows are stale, re-run the engine path that owns state resync: start or resume the workflow with `/aidlc`, or change scope through `/aidlc --scope <scope>` so the compiled graph and scope grid are reapplied
3. Use `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-shared/state-template.md` only as the section and field contract; do not restore stage rows by hand from the template

---

## Dispatched Stage Timeouts

**Symptom**: A dispatched stage (Reverse Engineering, Practices Discovery, User Stories, or Code Generation) returns errors or truncated output.

### What happens

The framework follows a built-in retry protocol:

1. **Automatic retry** with a reduced-context prompt
2. **If retry fails**, two options:
   - **Run inline** — execute the stage directly in the main conversation (no subagent boundary)
   - **Skip and revisit** — mark the stage incomplete and return later

### Manual recovery

Re-run `/aidlc` — it detects the `[-]` (in-progress) state and offers to resume or redo the stage. Check the `audit/` shards for the error entry to understand what failed.

---

## Approval Gate Stuck

**Symptom**: The workflow is waiting for your response at an approval gate.

### How to proceed

Type your response when prompted. Options are:

- **Approve** — continue to the next stage
- **Request Changes** — provide feedback for revision

### Revision loop escape hatch

After 3 revision cycles on the same stage, a third option appears: **Accept as-is**. This archives the current version and moves on.

### Skipping a stage

Use `/aidlc --stage <target>` to jump to a different stage. Intervening stages will be marked `[S]` (skipped) in the state file.

### A reviewed document needs another change

If a final review already covers the document, direct edits are blocked so the
review cannot silently certify different content.

- While the stage is active or awaiting approval, describe the change and choose
  **Request Changes**. The decision can be recorded before the gate opens.
- While the stage is `[R]`, restart it with `/aidlc --stage <slug>`.
- After the stage is `[x]`, restore the reviewed source state or jump back with
  `/aidlc --stage <slug>` to redo it.

When only workspace source changed and the one recovery review is still
available, start that recovery request before replacing the old Review section.
The pending request temporarily permits writes only to that stage or Unit while
the stale condition remains. Restoring the reviewed workspace source, recording
the verdict, or starting/resuming another session re-arms the freeze. Restoring
output-document bytes does not clear audit-recorded artifact staleness. After a
session restart, retry the same pending request before replacing the Review
section. The gate remains closed until the matching verdict is recorded.

### Plan Approval asked twice for the same plan

**Symptom**: Code Generation presents the Plan Approval question again for a plan
you already approved.

Plan Approval binds to the plan, unit test instructions, and Testing Contract
content, to the target, and to the current stage attempt. It is NOT reopened by
re-running `/aidlc`, by a session restart or a context compaction, by a Stop-hook
probe, or by `/aidlc --status`. Ticking a plan checkbox does not reopen it
either, and recording a review never touches the plan.

If you are asked again, one of these moved:

- the plan content (anything beyond a ticked task marker, or a terminal
  `## Review` section left by a review recorded before review records existed)
- the unit-test instructions content, any byte of it: the instructions are handed
  to the developer in full, so they bind byte-exactly, and a section appended to
  them after approval reopens it
- the Testing Posture, scope, test strategy, or project type
- the active Unit or stage target
- the stage attempt: a backward jump, a Request Changes, a gate rejection, or a
  workflow restart
- the workspace source, if it changed after the plan was fingerprinted

The refusal message names which one. On a workspace-source change the remedy is
always the same: re-run the fingerprint command, record both tags it prints, and
present the plan again. A fingerprint recorded by an older version of the tool
reads as "was written under an earlier format" and needs the same re-run.

### Plan Approval cannot be recorded and the remedies do not help

**Symptom**: you chose "Approve Plan" but the receipt command keeps refusing,
for example because the workspace source cannot be bound ("unbindable") or the
response was orphaned by a re-run decision.

Every refusal lists its remedies in order. Try the repair remedies first: repair
the source boundary the message names (shrink or exclude the offending path,
declare real source under an excluded directory in `.aidlc-source-paths.json`,
remove a broken symlink), re-run the fingerprint command, and let the plan be
presented again. `/aidlc --doctor` has a "Workspace source boundary binds" check
that names the failing path.

The last remedy is the break-glass exit, and only you can open it. Type exactly
`Override Plan Approval: <your reason>` as a chat message (a picked option does
not count). The conductor then runs the same receipt command with
`--override "<your reason>"`; the engine checks that the typed phrase exists for
this session with the same reason, records `PLAN_APPROVAL_OVERRIDDEN` together with
the checks it overrode, and writes a receipt bound to the plan content and stage
attempt only. The typed phrase is single-use. The conductor never proposes or
initiates this; if you did not type the phrase, the command refuses with "Plan
Approval override is human-only".

---

## Context Compaction

**Symptom**: Claude Code summarized earlier conversation context. The session may feel like it "forgot" recent discussion.

### What is preserved

All record-dir artifacts, `aidlc-state.md`, the `audit/` shards, and `.aidlc-recovery.md` persist on disk. Only in-memory conversation context and partial in-progress work not yet written to files is lost.

### How to recover

Run `/aidlc` after compaction. The framework:

1. Reads `aidlc-state.md` to load workflow position
2. Compares `.aidlc-recovery.md` against the state file — warns if they differ
3. Offers four resume options

If the recovery breadcrumb warns about a mismatch, choose **Redo current stage** to safely re-execute the stage that was in progress during compaction.

---

## Audit Log Growing Too Large

**Symptom**: this clone's audit shard has grown to thousands of lines over a long project.

### How to archive

```bash
# from the intent's record dir; <host>-<clone>.md is this clone's shard
mv audit/<host>-<clone>.md audit-archive/<host>-<clone>-2026-02.md
```

The next `/aidlc` invocation (or any hook-triggered write) creates a fresh shard. All audit content is safe to archive — the engine does not read the `audit/` shards for routing decisions.

### Git considerations

The `audit/` shards are committed (not gitignored) — see [What to Commit vs. Gitignore](14-artifacts-reference.md#what-to-commit-vs-gitignore). Each clone writes its own `<host>-<clone>.md` shard, so concurrent appends never merge-conflict; consider archiving (see above) before commits to keep diffs manageable.

---

## Lock Files Left Behind

**Symptom**: Hooks appear to hang briefly then skip. Subsequent audit entries are not written.

The audit hooks use `mkdir`-based locking (via `lib.ts`) to prevent concurrent writes. If a hook is interrupted, the lock directory may persist. Lock files are created in the system temp directory (`os.tmpdir()` -- typically `/tmp/` on macOS/Linux, `%TEMP%` on Windows).

### Finding stale locks

```bash
# macOS / Linux
ls -la /tmp/.aidlc-*

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem $env:TEMP -Filter ".aidlc-*"
```

Lock directories are named `.aidlc-audit-<hash>.lock` and `.aidlc-subagent-<hash>.lock` inside the system temp directory.

### Clearing stale locks

Run `/aidlc --doctor` first. It automatically clears only a provably-dead
generation, a reused PID whose creation generation no longer matches, or an old
lock whose owner stamp is genuinely missing. Matching/unknown live generations,
malformed stamps, and unreadable stamps are reported but not removed.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
rm -rf /tmp/.aidlc-audit-*.lock /tmp/.aidlc-subagent-*.lock

# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\.aidlc-audit-*.lock", "$env:TEMP\.aidlc-subagent-*.lock" -Recurse -Force
```

Manual removal is safe only after stopping all AI-DLC processes and confirming
the project is quiescent. Locks and their owner-stamped `.reap` recovery gates
are transient and recreated as needed. `.gate-mutex` files are persistent
advisory-lock anchors and may remain empty in the temp directory.

---

## Statusline Issues

### Shows "ready" when workflow is active

The statusline reads the `**Lifecycle Phase**` field from `aidlc-state.md`. If that field is missing or empty, it falls back to `[AIDLC] ready`.

**Fix:** Run `/aidlc --doctor` to check state file integrity. Verify the `## Current Status` section contains a `**Lifecycle Phase**` entry.

### Shows stale data

Expected behavior — the statusline updates when the state file is next written, typically at stage transitions.

### Not appearing at all

1. Run `aidlc doctor` and repair the reported native command or host wiring.
2. On a copy install, verify Bun is on the host process PATH.
3. On Claude, verify the `.claude/settings.json` `statusLine` entry exists.
4. With no state file, `[AIDLC] ready` is the expected output.

---

## Using `--doctor`

The `--doctor` utility command validates your setup. Run it whenever something seems wrong:

```
/aidlc --doctor
```

It checks: prerequisite (`bun`), hook availability (every hook `settings.json` wires — all 17 framework hooks — must exist in `.claude/hooks/`, and a wired-but-missing hook fails loudly), hooks-not-globally-disabled (a resolved `disableAllHooks: true` in any Claude Code settings layer fails loudly), managed project-hook policy (`allowManagedHooksOnly: true`), project structure (`settings.json`), workspace shell readiness (`.claude/` + `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`), state/audit consistency, hook heartbeats, graph integrity (no cycles, every graph entry has a file), the **Composed plugin surface** (enabled plugin stages are compiled; contribution sidecars and targets are valid; recorded structural additions and prose fragments remain present and unchanged), selection-aware plugin-authored checks, scope validation across all 11 scopes, stage schema + graph references, and keyword overlap across scopes. Passing advisory rows include **Duplicate producers** for consumed artifacts whose producer is ambiguous by graph load order, **Rule drift** (with lifecycle-stale overlaps reported separately as stale-suppressed), **Paired sensor coverage**, stage/gate ledgers with no `HUMAN_TURN`, approval gates waiting for a human for more than 24 hours, plugin advisory checks, uncommitted workspace records, fresh in-flight compose/background-subagent state, and, when `repos.json` exists, declared-repo and managed-`.gitignore` drift. A compose marker older than 24 hours or background-subagent entry older than 2 hours fails with the exact `rm aidlc/.aidlc-*` remediation; doctor never deletes either surface. **Hook drops** is conditional: a hook that silently degraded (e.g. a plugin compose that could not apply a contribution, or a failed recompile) records a severity-tagged line to `<hooks-health>/<hook>.drops`; a `[degraded]` drop **fails** doctor (so a CI gate catches a half-applied plugin), while an `[advisory]` drop (an expected/benign condition) is a passing row. The plugin compose hook rewrites its drops file each run, so fixing the cause and re-composing self-clears it. Clean and warnings-only reports exit 0; any failed check exits 1. Healthy rows collapse by section unless `--verbose` is present, while every warning and failure remains visible. The report writes to stdout either way. Core checks are **read-only**: on a fresh shell with no intent yet they create nothing, so the command is safe to run before the first intent is created. Plugin checks execute installed plugin code that is required by convention to be read-only, but the runtime cannot enforce that property. Once an intent exists doctor records a `HEALTH_CHECKED` (and `GUARDRAIL_LOADED`) audit row.

On Claude Code, doctor also reads the machine-managed `managed-settings.json` and alphabetical `managed-settings.d/` fragments. If the effective `allowManagedHooksOnly` value is `true`, organization policy blocks every hook declared by the project's `.claude/settings.json`; only the Claude Code administrator can lift that policy. If heartbeats are still absent after workflow progress, run `/hooks` to inspect approval and policy status, then fully restart the CLI session after hooks are approved.

Until an administrator changes the managed policy, an attended recovery session can launch the CLI with both `AIDLC_SKIP_HUMAN_PRESENCE_GUARD=1` and `AIDLC_SKIP_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION_GUARD=1`. These are temporary bypasses: they allow human-presence and consolidated-summary checkpoints to proceed without receipts that blocked hooks cannot mint, so use them only while a human is actively supervising the session.
When a workflow has issues, `--doctor` also prints a **Workflow diagnosis** section listing structured findings (unresolved gates, a stale or missing runtime graph, cold hooks, and similar "it will not advance" causes) — the same analysis `--doctor --export` writes to its report.

See [CLI Commands](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-doctor-health-check) for full details on what each check validates and how to fix failures.

---

## Sharing a Diagnostic Report

When a workflow is stuck or misbehaving — a gate that will not open, a stage that
will not advance, an approved report repeatedly refused — and you want a
maintainer to look, run:

```
/aidlc --doctor --export
```

This runs a fresh `--doctor` pass, then writes a small, **redacted** diagnostic
report to `aidlc/diagnostics/` (override with `--output <dir>`). It packages
a timestamped `.tar.gz` when a system `tar` is available; otherwise it keeps the
report directory and tells you to compress it yourself. Share that archive (or
directory) — it carries the diagnosis and redacted evidence, **not your work
product**. No workspace source, raw state/audit/runtime-graph files, or
artifact/contribution/question/memory bodies are included; paths are normalized,
intent ids are hashed, and secret-like values are scrubbed.

The report reconstructs the workflow timeline from the audit trail and runs
deterministic condition→remedy rules. The two most common causes it catches:

- **Unresolved approval gates** — a stage whose gate never resolved is the single
  most common "it will not advance" cause.
- **Stale or missing runtime graph / cold hooks** — a runtime graph older than its
  authored inputs (or absent), or a hook that has not fired in a long time,
  points at a recompile that did not run.

`report.md` inside the report lists every finding with a remedy; a remedy that
names a recovery bypass (such as an `AIDLC_DISABLE_*` env var) is flagged
as not safe to automate. See [CLI Commands](12-cli-commands.md#aidlc-doctor-export-write-a-diagnostic-report)
for the full report contents and safety model.
