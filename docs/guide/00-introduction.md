## What is AI-DLC?

AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) is a methodology for structuring AI-assisted software development into repeatable, traceable phases. It originated from the [AWS AI-DLC methodology](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/ai-driven-development-life-cycle/). This repository implements it natively from one harness-neutral core, so it runs inside the CLI harness you already use — today Claude Code, Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex CLI, Cursor, opencode, or GitHub Copilot. This guide is harness-neutral; where a detail differs by harness, it says so and points you to your harness's chapter (see [Running on other harnesses](harnesses/README.md)). Examples are shown in Claude Code unless noted.

You invoke it with a single command:

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

AI-DLC then guides you through a structured workflow — from capturing your intent, through requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment — while keeping you in control at every decision point.

## Philosophy: Small Mob, Broad Agents

Rather than dozens of narrow specialists (an approach that recreates waterfall handoff chains), AI-DLC uses **11 broadly capable agents** that each participate across multiple stages and phases. Each agent carries context across stages, eliminating handoffs and reducing coordination overhead.

This mirrors how effective human teams work: a mob of 3-5 people covers an entire feature, each bringing broad skills rather than a single narrow specialty.

## How the Orchestrator Works

At its core, AI-DLC runs a simple loop. A deterministic **engine** decides what happens next; the **conductor** (the `/aidlc` session, `SKILL.md`) carries it out, then asks the engine for the next move. Across that loop the framework:

1. **Reads stage files** — 33 stage definitions across 5 phases, each specifying inputs, steps, outputs, and the lead agent
2. **Loads agent personas** — Activates domain-expert perspectives (architect, developer, product manager, etc.) with specialized knowledge
3. **Manages state and audit** — Tracks progress in `aidlc-state.md` and logs every decision to the intent's `audit/` shards for traceability
4. **Delegates across stage topologies** — For focused autonomous work and multi-agent collaboration, dispatches subagents as a hub-and-spoke, pipeline, or mob
5. **Presents approval gates** — After each stage, you review and approve before the workflow advances

The engine owns the routing (which stage is next, which scope, when to stop); the conductor owns execution quality (running the stage well, asking good questions, surfacing decisions to you). Most stages run **inline**: the conductor adopts the agent's perspective and works directly with you in conversation. Four stages use dispatched topologies: Practices Discovery and Code Generation run as `subagent` hubs, Reverse Engineering as a two-link `pipeline`, and User Stories as a `mob`. The complete topology is 29 inline / 2 subagent / 1 pipeline / 1 mob. For the full architecture, see the Developer Reference's [Engine and Skill System](../reference/17-skill-system.md).

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is for anyone **using** AI-DLC to build software:

- **New users** — Start with [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md), [Workflow Profiles](workflow-profiles.md), [Your First Workflow](02-your-first-workflow.md), and [Spaces and Intents](03-spaces-and-intents.md)
- **Regular users** — Reference [CLI Commands](12-cli-commands.md), [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy](05-scopes-and-depth.md), and [Troubleshooting](15-troubleshooting.md)
- **Team leads** — See [Knowledge](08-knowledge.md) and [Rules and the Learning Loop](09-rules-and-the-learning-loop.md) for customizing AI-DLC to your team's standards

To reshape *how* AI-DLC behaves — add a stage or an agent, define a scope, author rules and sensors, or add team knowledge (all configuration, no code) — see the [Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md). For changing the AI-DLC codebase itself, see the [Developer Reference](../reference/00-overview.md).
