# Customization

AI-DLC is designed to adapt to your team's needs. This chapter covers settings overrides, scope configuration, stage customization, statusline, and tool permissions.

> **Harness-specific config.** The harness-neutral customizations — scope
> configuration, stage depth, knowledge, and rules — apply on every harness. The
> mechanism-level config in this chapter (`settings.json` / `settings.local.json`,
> the statusline command, `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, tool-permission blocks) is
> **Claude Code-specific**. Kiro CLI configures the equivalents in
> `.kiro/settings/cli.json` + its agent config; Kiro IDE uses agent Markdown
> `tools:` and `permissions.rules`. Codex uses `.codex/config.toml`
> + Starlark rules, Cursor in `.cursor/hooks.json` + `.cursor/cli.json`
> (permissions only), opencode in the project-root `opencode.json`, and Copilot
> in `.github/hooks/aidlc.json` (hook wiring) + `~/.copilot/config.json`
> (folder trust) — see
> [Running on Kiro CLI](harnesses/kiro-cli.md),
> [Running on Kiro IDE](harnesses/kiro-ide.md),
> [Running on Codex CLI](harnesses/codex-cli.md),
> [AI-DLC on Cursor](harnesses/cursor.md),
> [AI-DLC on opencode](harnesses/opencode.md), and

## Settings Overrides (`settings.local.json`)

The shared `.claude/settings.json` ships with the framework and is committed to version control. To override settings for your local environment without affecting the team, create a personal overrides file:

```bash
cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
```

This file is listed in `.gitignore` so your personal changes are never committed. Use it to:

- Override model selection (e.g., switch to a different Opus or Sonnet model ID)
- Set environment variables for your local setup
- Adjust tool permissions for your security requirements

---

## Agent Models and Effort (Tiers)

Shipped agents are authored with a `tier:` (`judgment` | `balanced` | `templated`) that the build projects into each harness's native model/effort keys — judgment agents inherit your session's model and effort, while balanced and templated agents both pin a mid-size model at `medium` effort on Claude Code, Codex, and opencode. Those two tiers currently project identically but remain distinct so either can be retuned independently. On Kiro, Cursor, and Copilot all tiers inherit the session model. See [Agent System](../reference/05-agent-system.md) for the full projection table.

To change ONE agent's behavior in your installed copy, edit the projected value directly — for example, set `model: opus` in a Claude agent's `.claude/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` frontmatter. On Kiro the surface depends on the harness: on Kiro CLI add a `"model"` field to the agent's `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.json`, and on Kiro IDE set a `model:` line in the agent's `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` frontmatter (the agent JSON files are CLI-only — the IDE reads the `.md` frontmatter when spawning). In both cases use a model ID enabled on your install; Kiro agents ship without a model pin so they inherit the session model by default. The edit survives until `aidlc config` refreshes that framework-owned file or you manually replace it from the same versioned `runtime/<harness>/` release payload. To cap EVERY agent when building your own distribution from source, set a `tier_cap:` in `core/memory/org.md`/`project.md` frontmatter or run the packager with `AIDLC_TIER_CAP=<tier>` — both are pack-time knobs on `bun scripts/package.ts`, not runtime settings.

---

## Per-Project Default Scope

When every workflow in a project should start at the same scope, set `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` in the `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` (the shipped file already has this set to `classic`, matching the framework's hard-coded fallback — set it to `feature` to run the full lifecycle by default):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE": "feature"
  }
}
```

> The shipped `env` block also contains Bedrock model IDs (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, etc.). Those are listed separately — the example above only shows the scope key for clarity.

With this set, bare `/aidlc` invocations use `feature` as the default scope. The env var is read at workflow initialization only; once the intent's `aidlc-state.md` exists (under its record dir), the state file is authoritative and env changes don't affect an in-flight workflow.

**Precedence (highest to lowest):**

1. Explicit CLI flag: `/aidlc feature` or `/aidlc --scope bugfix` wins.
2. Keyword detection in freeform text: `/aidlc fix the login bug` still maps to `bugfix`. Users can override the detected scope at the existing confirmation prompt.
3. `AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE` env var from `.claude/settings.json`.
4. Hard-coded fallback: `classic` — the single framework default, used by
   unmatched-freeform resolution, `/aidlc-init`, and a direct low-level
   `intent-create` call without `--scope`. Nothing else controls the implicit
   default.

**Valid values:** `enterprise`, `feature`, `mvp`, `poc`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `infra`, `security-patch`, `classic`, `workshop`, `express`. An invalid value errors at invocation time with a clear message. Teams can define additional scopes by dropping a `.claude/scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` file and tagging the member stages' `scopes:` lists — see [Contributing: Adding a Scope](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-a-scope). Teams can also define additional agents in `.claude/agents/` — see [Contributing: Adding an Agent](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-an-agent).

**Verifying the config:** run `/aidlc --doctor` to confirm the env var is set and valid:

```
✓  AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE=classic (valid)
```

**Init notice:** when the env default is applied, the orchestrator prints a one-line notice at workflow start (`Using scope=<value> from AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (.claude/settings.json)`) so the scope source is visible at the moment it takes effect.

Why only scope and not depth or test-strategy? Each scope declares a depth, and test strategy inherits that depth unless the scope overrides it. `classic` therefore starts at Standard/Standard, `workshop` at Standard/Minimal, and `express` at Minimal/Minimal. If you need to override either, pass `--depth` or `--test-strategy` on the CLI.

**Sensitive values:** `.claude/settings.json` is committed to version control. Don't put secrets, credentials, or personal overrides here — use `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) for anything sensitive.

---

## Scope Configuration

Scopes control which stages execute and at what depth and test strategy. AI-DLC provides 11 named scopes; the full table (EXECUTE/total stage counts, default depth, test strategy, and use case for each) is the single source in [Scopes, Depth, and Test Strategy § The 11 Core Scopes](05-scopes-and-depth.md#the-11-core-scopes). This section covers *configuring* and overriding them.

### Choosing a scope

Specify explicitly or let the orchestrator auto-detect:

```
/aidlc enterprise       # Explicit scope
/aidlc Build a payments API  # No keyword: offers composition; resolver fallback is "classic"
/aidlc Fix the login bug     # Auto-detects "bugfix"
```

### Overriding at runtime

You can override scope at any time during a workflow:

- **At any approval gate**: request a different scope or depth
- **Via utility command**: `/aidlc --scope enterprise` changes the active scope
- **Stage inclusion**: at approval gates in Ideation and Inception, you can add a previously skipped stage back into the workflow

---

## Change Control

Change Control is one setting with two values, `strict` and `relaxed`. It decides what happens when something you already approved or confirmed turns out to have changed underneath: the source files moved after you approved a code plan, a reviewed document was edited after its review, or an output was saved without the current summary confirmation.

- `strict` reopens the approval. The run stops with one plain sentence naming what changed (for example `2 files changed since this plan was approved: src/api.ts, src/db.ts. Look them over and approve the plan again to continue.`) and asks you again.
- `relaxed` keeps going. The change is recorded once in the audit trail as a `CHANGE_ACCEPTED` row, you hear one line about it (`... Continuing (Change Control: relaxed). Say 'review the plan again' to reopen approval.`), and the run continues. Nothing is deleted: the approval and its evidence stay exactly as they were.

Neither value removes a gate. Every approval question is still asked, a reviewer's verdict is never changed, and editing the approved plan itself (or its test instructions or Testing Contract) reopens approval under both values. Change Control only decides the consequence of an input change, not whether the framework notices it.

### Defaults per scope

| Scope | Default |
|-------|---------|
| enterprise, security-patch, infra | strict |
| poc, express, classic, bugfix, feature, mvp, refactor, workshop | relaxed |

A composed scope carries the value the composer proposed and you approved at its gate; a matched stock scope carries that scope's default.

### The three places to set it

1. **The scope file.** `change_control: strict | relaxed` in `scopes/aidlc-<name>.md` is the value every new intent on that scope starts with (absent means strict).
2. **Memory.** A `## Change Control` section with one line, `Mode: strict`, in `aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/org.md`, `team.md`, or `project.md` holds strict for everyone on the repo. It wins over the scope default and over any per-intent flip, which is then refused with a sentence naming the file. `Mode: relaxed` or an empty section changes nothing; any other value is a validation error naming the file and the two allowed values.
3. **The intent.** `/aidlc --change-control strict|relaxed`, or a plain-chat request such as "stop asking me to re-approve when files change", sets the value for the running piece of work (`/aidlc --status` shows it as `Change Control: relaxed (set by you)`).

### Where the value lives

The resolved value is written to the intent's `aidlc-state.md` at creation as `- **Change Control**: <value> (from scope <name>)`, rewritten by the flag or the chat request, and read by value only. Because the state file is committed with the intent, the value survives sessions and teammates see the same one; a memory edit that changes the effective value for a running intent is recorded as a `CHANGE_CONTROL_SET` row naming the memory file the next time a governed check runs. An intent created before this field existed stays `strict (not set)` until you set it; an invalid field is unavailable until `/aidlc --change-control strict|relaxed` repairs it. The next intent starts from its scope's default again.

## Stage Customization

Each stage is a self-contained `.md` file in `.claude/aidlc-common/stages/[phase]/`. Stage files specify:

- **Metadata** — Stage number, phase, execution mode, lead/support agents
- **Inputs** — Prior artifacts to load
- **Steps** — Numbered execution sequence
- **Outputs** — Artifacts to produce
- **Completion** — Approval gate pattern

To modify a stage's behavior, edit its stage file directly. All stages reference the stage protocol for shared patterns (approval gates, question format, state tracking).

### Depth levels

Each scope has a default depth that controls artifact detail:

| Depth | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Brief artifacts, targeted analysis, no optional content |
| **Standard** | Balanced detail, covers primary and secondary concerns |
| **Comprehensive** | Full detail, extensive analysis, all optional content included |

You can override depth at any approval gate by requesting a different level.

---

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

On **Claude Code**, this implementation displays a statusline in the terminal status bar showing workflow progress. The other harnesses have no statusline — they surface workflow position through `/aidlc --status` (Kiro, Cursor, opencode) and the `update_plan` task-progress item plus `$aidlc --status` (Codex):

```
[AIDLC] IDEATION [▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░] 4/7 > Intent Capture -- Product Agent
```

This shows, in order: current phase, phase progress (as a bar and a ratio — both scoped to the current phase), stage display name, and lead agent. Context usage appears on the right (e.g., `ctx:15%`), color-coded as the remaining context drops. When the Claude usage ledger has data, `↑<in> ↓<out> $<usd>` follows for the active workflow and current transcript/session only; prior workflows and sessions are excluded. Setting `AIDLC_DISABLE_USAGE_TRACKING=1` turns usage tracking off entirely and removes this segment.

### Configuration

The statusline is configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bun \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/aidlc-statusline.ts\""
}
```

### Customizing the format

Edit `.claude/hooks/aidlc-statusline.ts` directly. The output format is defined in the `main()` function near the end of the file. The hook reads phase, stage, and agent from `aidlc-state.md`, maps stage slugs to display names, and builds both the unicode progress bar and the `n/m` ratio from the same phase-local checkbox parse.

### Disabling the statusline

Remove the `statusLine` block from `settings.json`. The terminal status bar reverts to Claude Code's default.

---

## Tool Permissions

The `permissions.allow` list in `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves Claude Code tools so workflows run without per-call permission prompts:

```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "Read", "Edit", "Write",
    "Bash(bun \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tools/\"*)",
    "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "Task", "WebSearch"
  ]
}
```

The scoped `Bash(bun "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tools/"*)` entry sits ahead of the bare `Bash` so the framework's own tool invocations always match the narrower rule first. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` stays double-quoted (with the `*` outside the quotes) so the command survives word-splitting shells when the project path contains spaces while the permission matcher still globs.

### How permissions work

- **Project-wide ceiling**: The `settings.json` allow list is the maximum set of tools available
- **Claude Code agents inherit the full session toolset** by default; `disallowedTools: Task` blocks nested subagent spawning on this harness
- **Optional per-agent narrowing**: An agent can be narrowed by adding a `tools:` allowlist to its frontmatter — omit it to inherit everything. Listing `tools:` drops inherited MCP tools unless the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids are also listed

### Expanding permissions

Only add tools to the allow list if you create custom stages that need additional capabilities.

### Narrowing permissions

Remove tools from the allow list to require manual approval for each use. Note that removing `Task` causes the four dispatched stages (2.1 Reverse Engineering pipeline, 2.2 Practices Discovery subagent, 2.4 User Stories mob, 3.5 Code Generation subagent) to prompt for permission on each delegation. Workspace detection (0.2) runs deterministically inside `aidlc-utility intent-create` — it does not use `Task`.

## Extending AI-DLC

The settings, scopes, depth, and stage edits above cover day-to-day tuning of a workflow you run. When you want to reshape the framework itself for your team — add a stage, add an agent, define a scope, teach a standing rule, wire a deterministic check, or add domain knowledge — that's a distinct job with its own guide: the **[Harness Engineer Guide](../harness-engineering/00-overview.md)**.

The dividing line is data versus code. Everything in that guide is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter or a JSON config that the framework reads — no TypeScript edits. Where to go for each extension:

| You want to… | Start at |
|--------------|----------|
| Edit what a stage does, or add a new stage | [Anatomy of a Stage](../harness-engineering/01-anatomy-of-a-stage.md), [Adding a Stage](../harness-engineering/02-adding-a-stage.md) |
| Add or modify an agent | [Adding an Agent](../harness-engineering/03-adding-an-agent.md) |
| Define or tune a scope | [Scopes](../harness-engineering/04-scopes.md) |
| Teach a standing rule, or operate the learning loop | [Rules and the Learning Loop](../harness-engineering/05-rules-and-the-loop.md) |
| Wire a deterministic check (sensor) into a stage | [Sensors](../harness-engineering/06-sensors.md) |
| Add team domain knowledge | [Team Knowledge](../harness-engineering/07-team-knowledge.md) |

If your change is to the framework's *code* — the orchestrator, a hook, a CLI tool, the compile pipeline — that's the [Developer Reference](../reference/00-overview.md).
