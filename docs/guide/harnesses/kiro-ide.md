# Running AI-DLC on Kiro IDE

One of the framework's harnesses: the Kiro IDE runtime runs the same AI-DLC
methodology inside [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/). One deterministic core —
the tools, 33 stage files, protocols, knowledge, sensors, scopes, and rules —
is byte-shared across every harness; only the shell (skills, agent surfaces,
hook wiring, activation) differs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Run AI-DLC on Kiro IDE with Claude Opus 4.8.** The conductor drives a
> multi-step ritual per stage — clarifying questions, artifact generation, a
> reviewer pass, the learnings ritual, then the approval gate. Opus 4.8
> follows the full ritual and pauses correctly at every gate. Weaker models
> skip optional steps (the reviewer pass and the learnings ritual) and may
> rush gates. Set the chat model to **Claude Opus 4.8** before starting a
> workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Kiro IDE**, signed in
- **Claude Opus 4.8** selected as the chat model (see the note above)
- **bun** only when generating or running the source/development `dist/`
  projection. Native installs and versioned release runtimes are
  self-contained.

> [!TIP]
> For a source-generated `dist/` install, bun must be on the PATH that
> *non-interactive* shells see
> — that's what the IDE uses to run a hook or tool. Those shells read
> `~/.zshenv` (zsh) or `~/.bashrc` (bash), not `~/.zshrc`, but the bun
> installer writes to `~/.zshrc`. If `which bun` works in your terminal yet
> hooks can't find bun, copy the `BUN_INSTALL`/`PATH` export into
> `~/.zshenv` (or `~/.bashrc`).

## Install

### Native channel (recommended)

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  -o "$tmp/install.sh"
sh "$tmp/install.sh"
rm -rf "$tmp"
cd your-project
aidlc config
aidlc doctor
```

The installer verifies the release metadata, executable, and all-harness runtime archive against the published SHA-256 checksums. The installed runtime does not require Bun, Node.js, or Git. Harness selection happens in `aidlc config`.

On Windows, download `install.ps1` and run
`& $installer`. An interactive run may omit the flag;
redirected input, `pwsh -NonInteractive`, `--yes`, `--json`, and `--quiet`
require it. For an air-gapped package, use
`install.sh --from <release-directory> --offline` on Unix or
`& $installer -From <release-directory> -Offline` on Windows.

`aidlc config` projects the IDE shell before the project is opened. It merges the
native `aidlc engine *` trust entry into `.vscode/settings.json` without replacing
user-owned settings. Open `your-project/` in Kiro IDE and run
`/aidlc --doctor` in chat before the first workflow.

### Versioned manual-copy alternative

Download and extract a specific release's `aidlc-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` as described in
[Install and Lifecycle: Copy Channel](../18-install-and-lifecycle.md#copy-channel),
then set `RUNTIME_ROOT` to the extracted `runtime/` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.kiro your-project/aidlc
# Safe on fresh installs; required when upgrading from v2.5.56 or earlier.
for retired_hook in \
  audit-logger block mint runtime-compile stop sync-statusline
do
  rm -f \
    "your-project/.kiro/hooks/aidlc-${retired_hook}.json" \
    "your-project/.kiro/hooks/aidlc-${retired_hook}.kiro.hook"
done
rm -f \
  your-project/.kiro/agents/aidlc.json \
  your-project/.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.json \
  your-project/.kiro/settings/cli.json
cp -R "$RUNTIME_ROOT/kiro-ide/.kiro/." your-project/.kiro/
cp -R "$RUNTIME_ROOT/kiro-ide/aidlc/." your-project/aidlc/     # the workspace shell (spaces/default/memory) — a sibling of .kiro/, not inside it
cp "$RUNTIME_ROOT/kiro-ide/AGENTS.md" your-project/AGENTS.md   # merge if you already have one
# Existing .gitignore: preserve it and merge only the section beginning "# AI-DLC".
if [ ! -e your-project/.gitignore ]; then
  cp dist/kiro-ide/.gitignore your-project/.gitignore
fi
```

The first removal loop is the v2.5.57 hook-name migration. The second removes
Kiro CLI-format agent JSON and settings files shipped by older IDE
distributions. An overlay copy cannot delete retired files. Both removals are
no-ops on a fresh install. After that cleanup, the
`cp -R <src>/. <dst>/` form copies the tree **contents** whether
`your-project/.kiro` already exists or not. A plain
`cp -r "$RUNTIME_ROOT/kiro-ide/.kiro" your-project/.kiro` nests a second `.kiro` inside an
existing `.kiro/` and the IDE never sees the new files.

The `aidlc/` directory is the workspace shell — it ships the pre-built
`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` method tree the engine reads. It is a **sibling**
of `.kiro/`, so copy it separately (or copy the whole
`$RUNTIME_ROOT/kiro-ide/` tree at once). `/aidlc --doctor` fails its
"workspace shell ready" check if it is missing.

The versioned runtime uses the native `aidlc` command. Framework developers who
need the Bun-shaped source projection can clone the repository, run
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun scripts/package.ts`, then use the
ignored local `dist/kiro-ide/` output instead.

The shipped `.gitignore` carries the workspace's commit/ignore split: the
per-user cursors (`aidlc/active-space`, `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/active-intent`)
and machine-local runtime (`aidlc/.aidlc-clone-id`, `runtime-graph.json`, sensor
caches, `spaces/*/knowledge/.sources.local.json`) stay untracked, while the
shared records — method memory, state, audit shards, artifacts — travel with
git. The guarded command copies the complete starter file only when the project
has no `.gitignore`. If one exists, preserve every project-owned rule and merge
only the section from `# AI-DLC` through the end of the shipped file; do not
copy its generic starter rules. The `## Git Integration` section of the
installed `AGENTS.md` assumes the AI-DLC rules are in place before your first
workflow.

Open `your-project/` in Kiro IDE. The install ships:

- `.kiro/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md` — the conductor loaded when you invoke
  `/aidlc`.
- `.kiro/agents/aidlc.md` — the same conductor exposed in the IDE workspace
  agent selector.
- `.kiro/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md` — all 14 delegation personas, carrying
  IDE-native `tools:` grants and `permissions.rules`. No agent-v1 JSON or
  `settings/cli.json` ships in the IDE distribution.
- `.kiro/steering/aidlc-active-memory.md` — always-included IDE steering whose
  live file references preload the active-space memory files for both the
  conductor and delegated agents.
- `.kiro/hooks/aidlc-*.json` — the framework hooks registered in the IDE's
  native v2 hook format. They appear in the IDE's Agent Hooks panel. (Kiro IDE
  1.x no longer executes the legacy `.kiro.hook` format the harness shipped
  before; on those builds legacy hooks are silently inert.)

In the chat panel, run `/aidlc --doctor` to verify the setup, then
`/aidlc <description>` to start a workflow.

## Usage

Identical to the Claude Code harness: `/aidlc <description>` starts a
workflow, `/aidlc --status` reports position, `/aidlc --doctor`, `--stage`,
`--phase`, `--depth`, `--test-strategy`, and `--config [section]` all work, and the
per-stage (`/aidlc-domain-design`) and per-scope (`/aidlc-feature`) runner
skills are installed. There is no init command; the shipped shell scaffolds
the workspace, and AI-DLC automatically creates the first intent on your first `/aidlc`.

## How hooks work on Kiro IDE

Kiro IDE registers hooks through v2 hook JSON files
(`{"version":"v1","hooks":[{name,trigger,matcher,action}]}`, PascalCase
triggers) under `.kiro/hooks/` (a different mechanism from Kiro CLI, which
reads a `hooks` block inside the agent JSON). Native hook commands route through
`aidlc engine adapter kiro-ide`; source/development copies route through the projected
`aidlc-kiro-adapter.ts` shim. Both normalize the IDE event into the shape the
shared core hooks expect.

Kiro IDE 1.x delivers hook context as **JSON on stdin** (snake_case:
`{ session_id, tool_name, tool_input, tool_response }`; the older 0.12 builds instead set
the `USER_PROMPT` environment variable with a camelCase equivalent, and the
adapter accepts both). Captured PostToolUse write/shell events leave tool inputs
empty on both channels, so their written path must be recovered from the result
text and audit-tail hooks (`rebuild-stage-graph`, `sync-workflow-state`) run
from the audit trail. The graph-rebuild route also retains the shell result and session
identity so a successful `intent-create` binds to the invoking session: modern
events carry the exact `session_id`, while the legacy channel derives a stable
host-instance identity from the measured `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK`/`VSCODE_PID`
environment and retains it at SessionStart. Modern Stop likewise prefers its
event-local `session_id`, preventing one concurrent chat from consuming
another chat's post-create handoff; legacy agentStop falls back to the retained
identity. Later 1.x builds populate some PreToolUse and delegation inputs; the
adapter preserves those fields. On Windows, deterministic utilities use those
seams to avoid the IDE shell-result transport: builds that expose the submitted
prompt run the utility at UserPromptSubmit, while builds such as 1.0.242 (whose
prompt field is empty) fall back to the exact `execute_pwsh` PreToolUse command.
The utility runs once per turn, its UTF-8 text is relayed without terminal
protocol/control bytes, and the duplicate shell call is refused. Modern chats
store turn and output state per `session_id`; context without a session identity
uses one legacy compatibility bucket. Pre-1.0 camelCase payloads take the same
fallback through `toolArgs.command`; raw prompt text is only a newer-generation
compatibility shape.

The payload acquisition is **gated to payload-dependent targets**
(`audit-and-sensors`, `log-subagent`, `plan-approval-guard`,
`rebuild-stage-graph`), the terminal-command seams, plus `session-start` and
`continue-workflow` for their modern `session_id`, and `record-human-turn` for
the exact approval response. A non-empty `USER_PROMPT` is consumed immediately
on 0.12 builds (which open stdin without ever writing); otherwise the adapter
reads the 1.x stdin channel with a 2s broken-channel ceiling. Every other target
- including the approval floor, which fires on every `PreToolUse` - touches
neither channel and keeps its zero-latency path.

| Hook | Trigger (matcher) | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| `aidlc-session-start` | `SessionStart` | Injects workflow resume context once per session (the legacy pre-1.0 file stays wired to per-prompt `promptSubmit` — that generation has no session-start trigger) |
| `aidlc-mint` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Records a human-turn event on every prompt (human-presence gate) |
| `aidlc-terminal-command` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Runs status, doctor, help, navigation, and other terminal utilities before the model when prompt text is available |
| `aidlc-terminal-command-guard` | `PreToolUse` (`execute_bash\|execute_pwsh\|shell`) | Fallback for empty-prompt IDE versions: runs the classified utility once and refuses the duplicate Windows shell call |
| `aidlc-continue-workflow` | `Stop` | Forwarding-loop audit (advisory-only; the Stop trigger cannot block on the IDE - enforcement relies on the conductor's own Stop protocol) |
| `aidlc-block` | `PreToolUse` | Hard-blocks tool calls while an approval gate is open and no human has acted since (human-presence floor) |
| `aidlc-write-audit-log` | `PostToolUse` (`fs_write\|str_replace\|fs_append`) | Logs artifact create/update, then fires applicable sensors (path from the tool result) |
| `aidlc-plan-approval-guard` | `PreToolUse` | Enforces Code Generation Plan Approval with exact target classification when arguments are present. The shell tool is recognised under all three IDE names, `execute_bash`, `execute_pwsh` (Windows), and `shell`: each is forwarded to the shared guard as `Bash` and routed to legacy recovery identically, and with no active workflow no shell call is denied. Legacy argument-less payloads permit only measured `fs_write`/`str_replace` plan-question writes. PostToolUse stays silent because 0.12 discards that output; the invoking Code Generation `next`/final `continue` directive carries one protected choice capability. Recovery first requires an exact human `Recover Plan Approval` response; another live window cannot initiate it, while a replacement window can recover after the owner PID exits or an IPC-only endpoint disappears. Takeover clears old response evidence before rotating the challenge. An interrupted pre-write window remains a recovery latch even when PostToolUse never runs; definitive `toolSuccess:false` or recognized failure prose clears it because no mutation occurred, while unknown outcomes remain latched. Adapter-owned recovery preserves the human ask while clearing only violation/window state after successful reissue. `UserPromptSubmit` can submit exact recovery/approval labels but cannot reveal or transfer them. Unknown mutators fail closed and shared files/audit retain no plaintext secret. |
| `aidlc-log-subagent` | `PostToolUse` (`^(subagent_.+\|invoke_sub_agent)$`) | Records `SUBAGENT_COMPLETED` with the delegate's identity. The matcher is broad so any delegate name reaches the adapter; the adapter drops the auxiliary `subagent_response` shell |
| `aidlc-rebuild-stage-graph` | `PostToolUse` (`execute_bash`) | Recompiles the runtime graph (gated on the audit tail) |
| `aidlc-sync-workflow-state` | `PostToolUse` (`execute_bash`) | Forward-only sync of `Current Stage` from the latest `STAGE_STARTED` in the audit (the IDE surfaces no task payload to parse) |

`aidlc-session-end` has **no v2 registration**: the IDE's `Stop` trigger fires
at the end of every assistant turn, not at conversation close, so registering
it would append a spurious `SESSION_ENDED` between prompts in the same
session. It stays legacy-only (`agentStop`, pre-1.0 builds) until the IDE
exposes a genuine session-end event — on IDE 1.x no `SESSION_ENDED` is
recorded.

You will see a "Run Command Hook" line in chat each time one fires.

### Debugging hooks

If a hook isn't behaving as expected, turn on debug logging and each hook
appends its decision path (which gate it took, the resolved paths, why it
exited) to `<record>/.aidlc-hooks-health/hook-debug.log`. It is **off by
default** — no log is written and there is no overhead on a normal run. Two
ways to enable it, either works:

- **Filesystem marker (easiest on Kiro IDE):** `touch aidlc/.aidlc-hook-debug`
  in your project. It takes effect on the very next hook fire — no IDE restart —
  and `rm aidlc/.aidlc-hook-debug` turns it back off.
- **Environment variable:** `export AIDLC_HOOK_DEBUG=1`. Because the IDE runs
  hooks in non-interactive shells, set it where those shells read it — add the
  export to `~/.zshenv` (zsh) or `~/.bashrc` (bash), then restart the IDE.

## What's different on Kiro IDE

| Area | Claude Code | Kiro IDE |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Hook registration | `settings.json` `hooks` block | `.kiro/hooks/aidlc-*.json` v2 hook files (IDE >= 1.0) + `.kiro/hooks/aidlc-*.kiro.hook` legacy files (pre-1.0); both shipped, no double-firing |
| Gates & questions | `AskUserQuestion` widget | Numbered prose options (reply with a number); the questions FILE with `[Answer]:` tags stays the source of truth |
| Statusline | Current stage + model + context % | Not available — use `/aidlc --status` and the progress line at each gate |
| Dispatched stages (2.1 pipeline, 2.2 subagent, 2.4 mob, 3.5 subagent) | `Task` tool | Kiro `subagent` tool → all 14 Markdown personas; the IDE reads `tools:` and `permissions.rules` from each agent's frontmatter |
| Construction swarm | Parallel `Task` floor, optional ultracode Workflow | Subagent fan-out only; `AIDLC_USE_SWARM=1` is announced as a no-op |
| Session audit events | `SESSION_STARTED/RESUMED/ENDED`, `SESSION_COMPACTED` | `SESSION_STARTED` only on IDE 1.x (no genuine session-end trigger — `SESSION_ENDED` is recorded only by the legacy hook on pre-1.0 builds; no pre-compaction event) |
| MCP servers | Ships 5 (`.mcp.json`: `context7` + four AWS servers) | None shipped |

Everything else — state machine, audit trail, artifacts under the per-intent
record dir (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`), the learnings
ritual, sensors, scopes, depth/test-strategy — behaves identically, because it
IS identical: native installs dispatch through `aidlc`, while source copies run
the corresponding tools from `.kiro/tools/`.

A project's `aidlc/` workspace is harness-neutral. Moving a project between
harnesses (or running both side by side) is supported-but-untested; `/aidlc
--doctor` will warn if it detects a conflicting harness setup with an active
workflow.

## For framework developers

`dist/kiro-ide` is **generated** from `core/` + `harness/kiro-ide/` by
`bun scripts/package.ts kiro-ide` (core copy with the `{{HARNESS_DIR}}` token
substituted to `.kiro` and the `rules/` → `steering/` rename). The output is
ignored and local. `bun scripts/package.ts --check` builds twice in independent
temporary roots and byte-compares the results as the CI determinism guard. The
authored
Kiro IDE surfaces live in `harness/kiro-ide/`: the orchestrator skill
(`skills/aidlc/`), always-included active-memory steering (`steering/`),
the conductor Markdown (`agents/aidlc.md`), the hook adapter and v2 hook JSON
files (`hooks/`), and onboarding fills — edit those
(or `core/`), never hand-edit the generated `dist/kiro-ide`.

The IDE harness differs from the CLI harness (`harness/kiro/`) in four ways:
the `/aidlc` skill and `agents/aidlc.md` are its conductor surfaces rather than
an agent selected through `settings/cli.json`; it ships v2 hook JSON files (the
CLI relies on the agent-JSON `hooks` block); it preloads standing rules through
always-included steering rather than CLI agent resources; the shared Kiro
projection removes the core persona's Claude-only `disallowedTools` key; and
the IDE manifest adds native `tools:` and `permissions.rules` frontmatter.
Kiro IDE does not read or ship the CLI's agent-v1 JSON or `settings/cli.json`
surfaces.
